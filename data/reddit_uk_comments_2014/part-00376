Borini isn't getting picked because Rodgers is trying to drive him out of the club. That really is obvious. He done he same thing with Daniel Agger.

&gt;  But why should Coutinho (who is far better as an impact sub atm) and Lallana be picked ahead of them after they started the 0-0 with sunderland when we registered 2 shots on goal?

Because they're more likely to create something than Henderson and Allen? We needed to win this game remember, not draw it.

&gt; As for Rodgers in-game management, Markovic and Sterling were working well creating space and drawing fouls. The red card for Markovic was an anomaly. Moreno replaced Enrique who is probably low on fitness. Coutinho did his usual impressive display off the bench.

Its very simple. Opinions, discussions, pros and cons. Its all good.

The moment you start publically agitating for the manager to be sacked, in Dec, months after almost winning the title, thats when the line is crossed.

That just contributes fuel to further pressure, detrimental to the supposedly shared objective.

If you're not loudly and repeatedly screaming for the above, then nothing in this post applies to you. And so you can rein in the tearful replays of ""that day when a scouser was mean to me"".

I wouldn't describe a player that has scored 1 goal in Serie A since the start of the season and is already being sent home as an 'astute' signing.


&gt;Nobody's saying Torres is going to be the answer to our problems

If a player isn't seen as some sort of answer to our problems then there's no point in signing him.

&gt;but he can't really do worse than Borini and Lambert

There's a good possibility he could.

&gt;The fact of the matter is, the squad is in a whole lot of turmoil and someone experienced like him, a fan favourite and someone who's had immense success with Stevie couldn't really harm the team as much as the incapability of our current strikers has.

When Torres played his best for us, the team was built around him, he won't have that luxury this time, himself and Gerrard also aren't the same players they were 5 years ago so seeing them linking up so well again isn't guaranteed.  

&gt;I know everyone wants us to go out there and purchase Shaqiri, Cabaye and Cech and our season will be saved but simply put, why would FSG do that for Rodgers after his signings of Markovic, Lambert, Lovren, Lallana, Can and Moreno have only lowered the quality of the squad?

What the fans want doesnt come into the equation when we're signing players, Brendan will be given the season to work with the players bought and rightfully so. If FSG don't give him funds for new players then so be it, hell have to work with what he has.

false,bawbawbaw1,,Belfast,"&gt;  Surely the customer in insisting that the baker promote their political views, is the one forcing their opinions on others

Gay rights isn't a political issue, its a social issue, an issue of giving rights to people who do not conform to the rest of society, assuming for a minute that society is naturally heterosexual (which I will point out that historically it is not, but it certainly is biologically because heterosexualty is how we populate and expand). Its an issue that goes way beyond politicians and politics, unlike issues such as budget management. It is not for politicians to sort out social issues, they have a part in it but they aren't the only lot involved and the DUP are making it their own.

I get and understand the bakery, they don't believe in gay rights, they did not want to promote it, and I actually do believe that is their right so they do have sympathy from me even though I fully support equality for the LGBT community. 

The difference here is that they are not being asked to promote a political point of view but a moral/social view that is at odds with their religion and they are a business. The fact that it is a business means they should serve all, particularly as the person asking for the cake (as far as I am aware) were not aware of their affiliation, and believed they were a bog standard bakery. The bakery chose to bring their religious views into their business and that on its own is not very good grounds to run a business. 

When we look at a lot of very important charities (the new business for all purposes) in NI, they work with Christian ethos (paricularly Vincentian). I've worked for many of them and still work for one yet I am atheist - would it be discrimination if they didn't employ me? Would it be discriminatory for me if I didn't promote their ethos? Is it discriminatory that these services work with muslims, other christians, hindus, atheists, jews, yet do not want to advance their beliefs? 

You raise important points so I don't see the point in downvoting, but I'd like you to answer these questions. Where do we draw the line where religion impacts business and the rights of others. For all intents and purposes, religious beliefs are secondary when they open their doors to the general public, in my opinion. Religion should be a private affair, our history is defined by religious problems, religion has not been a friend of society, it seeks to dominate it, and thats exactly what the DUP want to do.

Folks who argue renting vs mortgaging always seem to bring out the trope of  having to spend £1000 on a new boiler or £10k on a new roof every 5 minutes.

The fact of the matter is that you'll only need to replace your boiler maybe after 20+ years, and a roof will probably last twice that.

The roof on my house has been there for 100 years and will probably last another 50.

If renting were *actually* cheaper than buying there would be no such thing as rental housing as every landlord would have gone bust a long time ago.

Renting is basically paying a convenience fee should you wish to move at short notice, which is great for those which this is applicable to and who are willing to pay for that convenience. However it's bad for those who *want* to buy but can't scrape together a deposit while at the same time paying someone else's mortgage on the house they're renting.

I'm sure we all know people who complain about not being able to pull together a deposit for a house while at the same time having two new cars on the driveway (both on tick).

Buying a car on tick is sort of similar to renting a house. If HP or leasing was cheaper than owning every car finance company would be making no money. You HP/lease a car either because you want to appear better off than you are, or... (as is the case with most people who finance cars) you're willing to pay the huge premium to always have a reliable car and to not have to worry about repairs, servicing, maintenance, MOT, AA cover, etc. 

To me the second argument is fair enough, but pretending it's cheaper is false dichotomy.

Also I have to mention this, Gerrard is pretty past it.. He's not the player he was and we have to live with the fact that he's all we have right now, it doesn't make it ideal..

I do a bit of game shooting now-and-then and there are basically three types of people involved in the sport...

1. 'Landed gentry': These folks own silly amounts of land, big 10+ bedroom houses, huge shooting estates that have been in the family for generations. On paper they have oodles of money although 99% of it is tied up in assets and they struggle to heat their massive houses (what a terrible shame). They drive shit cars day-to-day although the missus insists on keeping up appearances so they *have to* have a new car 'for best', they may also have an old classic tucked away in a shed somewhere.

2. '10-bob millionaires': these guys are sort of upper middle-class, they've worked hard, maybe from working-class backgrounds, maybe own a small business which is doing okay. They shoot because it's what you're supposed to do when you're posh and are in group 3. They drive brand-new Range Rovers, X5s, sports cars, etc.

3. 'Farmer types', These are folks who own a bit of land they farm. They shoot because their dad &amp; granddad did and they've had a shotgun in their hand since before they could walk. They club together with their next-door neighbor farms, put a few pheasants down and do a bit of informal shooting. To pay for the birds, conservation work &amp; land-management they might take a few quid of some guys in #2 to help cover costs. They drive old beat up Land Rovers and second-hand Range Rovers.

---

I'm firmly in group 3 but I know quite a few folks from #1 &amp; 2, and plenty of people who fall somewhere in-between.

The car thing is very distinct though.

Theres not much in between the two. 


Everyone gets on the PC train here but not everyone has the time to build pcs, investigate specs, optimize every game, keep up to date with what to get, thinking before buying every game if it works or not. If you have a fortune to blow then you can make a PC good enough to run 95% games but even then 5% quite simply will give you trouble. 10% quite simply will still be shit because they just so happened to be shit for you specific card or motherboard. You are out of luck and nothing you can do.



Now people will say ""you're stupid I can build a good PC for 1,000$"" well yes you can but that just proves my point. You'll be configuring 20 settings for the new/next games coming out enabling disabling shaders, settings draw distances, changing fps changing resolutions, changing texture quality, changing shadows heck every game has different 20 settings to optimize it which is something not everyone has time for. 



I was a PC gamer all my life but I don't use my gaming pc anymore and it just gathers dust for this sole reason.


Even though they are infinitely better graphic and performance wise (if everything works) they can also be bad as shit and just waste time and basically an inconvenience when all you want to so is play a game. 


Sometimes I just want to put a disc in, press a button and play a game with my daughter after a long day and a PC is horrible for that. I don't want to look at the back of discs before buying them checking every single detail to see if it will work. I don't want to see my pc getting older and worse as new games come out or sit on a chair to look at a monitor after already doing it all day at work.  Yeah i know controllers work with PCs but they wont bother telling you the shittiness that is key mapping or connecting a tower to a television in the living room for all to play on, then connecting it back for your personal use or for the very start installing and mapping 3-4 controllers for a multiplayer PC game. Hey but one time thing so whats the issue? Now do it for every game you install every time.

PCs work great online but local gaming is crap and lan isn't an option these days. Most people buying consoles are basing their choice on this for a start.


Games like Farcry 4 still cause problems on many modern pcs just because of the way they are made. Its not that the pcs are bad but its because the designers just didn't care enough and didn't optimize it or plainly gave a shit. On a console its one of the most fun games out there and works flawlessly.


So yeah its the apple vs android thing again. Games work better on ios too because they are basically the consoles of phones. There are far tok many types of pcs and androids out there and producers have to account for most of them to capture the market.


I don't play games on my phone so I have an android because apple is far too limited but for normal users the apple might be a much better phone.



IMO get a PS4 but its not really a show stealer as people say, the Xbox One for all the hate it gets is still pretty good when you see the benefits behind its supposive flaws. 


Get a PC if you want to be a dedicated gamer and can kepp up with it all and can see yourself being interested in all this stuff for the next 4-5 years.

I'm American too and I know the colleges seem crazy and overwhelming. The first way to narrow down your choices is by figuring out which colleges accept which kinds of degree areas. Not every college takes students from every area. Fortunately, this is listed on the college descriptions which you can find online. Similarly, if there is a specific professor you're interested in working with, you might see which college they are a fellow with and consider applying there. 

You'll also want to consider the ratio of grad students to undergrads and how lively the MCR/HCR is (these are the initials for graduate common rooms) at each college. I did my MSc there and our experience is very different than the undergrads. I would suggest going to the individual college websites and seeing what events and calendars the MCR/HCR have posted.

You may also want to look at where the college is located in relation to the pharmacology department, access to bike paths to the hospital (in case you're doing any research up there), and where each colleges housing is located. Undergraduates get to stay in college. Graduate students are usually in annexes.  Location does matter. Yes Oxford is small and yes you can walk/cycle everywhere, but...do you really want to carry all those heavy groceries from Tesco? What about beer runs to Sainsburys? If you're up at LMH in Norham Gardens then you're just...inconvenient. Same goes for Wolfson. It's not too much of a walk until it's 1am and you're drunk. There's some good bops (giant parties, usually themed) in the colleges that are farther away, like Green Templeton and St. Antony, but there's fun things everywhere so location becomes really more of a personal preference.

yeah there's people who take the piss but fraud is so small, around 1%, that it makes no sense other than the abolition of disability benefits all together to go after people on them.  

seriously the amount of people looking into benefit fraud is higher than the amount of people looking into tax fraud.  which one is worth more and which one affects the rich.  the answer is the same to both questions.

Absolutely agreed.

They are driving vulnerable people to suicide, making disabled people homeless, always blaming someone else for the direct consequences of *their* actions, (a friend of mine with a stage 4 metastasising cancer a couple of weeks ago had to get her Macmillan nurse to contact the DWP **for the third time now** to explain that as my friend was rather busy dying, she would *again* have to decline their kind invitation being as she was, unable to attend work-based interviews for ""health"" reasons: but I feel sure the DWP staff would insist ""We are just doing our jobs, following orders...""(now *where* have I heard *that* before?)) and all the time there is this constant vilification of this, that, or the other group to continue the electorate's distraction from, and ignorance of, the ubiquitous corruption that *is* Westminster, Whitehall and the City of London.

The Secretary of State responsible for the DWP's treatment of disabled people (including the actions of ATOS) should be taken out and horsewhipped for what he has put people through, sadly that's not possible under UK law, but imprisonment and sequestration of all his assets might go some way to alleviate the pain he has inflicted on those *he* has victimised (those that are still alive anyway) by his deliberate and calculated actions (and of course deliberate omissions of action).

The group that *needs* vilification, investigation and prosecution is the politicians, and all those that have traded personal integrity and the interests of their constituents for a nice comfortable seat on the board of a large corporation (or similar) when they retire from politics, need to be brought to book for corruption, and those that paid the bribes imprisoned for bribery.

This country is on it's knees because of one thing, **corruption**, in the form of political graft, nepotism, cronyism, kickbacks, profiteering and greed.

Who but the corrupt could possibly dispute that **going after those that are corrupt/criminal in Westminster, Whitehall and the City of London is the right thing to do** ?

There's not be one game since he started playing more forward and less frequently that I thought he looked bad.

Now if he wants to move to a league where he would get more playing time though he deserves that if it's what he wants.  I would hold nothing against him if he moved to mls because he would absolutely tear the league apart while getting more playing time.  The only way I want to see him gone from Liverpool is if it is his own decision.

false,lepusfelix,null,null,"&gt; Myself along with millions of others sit in traffic everyday often for hours on end. 30 years ago when I left school I commuted to London from Morden at the end of the Northern Line and got a seat every day.

There are more drivers now. Almost everyone over the age of 17 drives. Almost every adult owns a car, sometimes including the family dog. 30+ years ago, cars were considered expensive, and most people didn't have them. If there were people willing to share their cars with others, there'd be less traffic on the roads.

As for commuting, again the situation is different. Nowadays people commute. Back then, you could afford to live near where you worked, so it was either a quick walk away or a bus journey away. Commuting long distances on bus and tube were the preserve of people who were going out for the day in the city.

I don't drive. Couldn't afford a car even if I did. Plus I work too long and at the wrong hours to be able to afford the time for lessons. But even if I was loaded and had the time, I still wouldn't drive. I just don't see the point of it. Everything I want is either online or within 20 minutes walk of my home, and work is half an hour by bus.

&gt; You cannot even breath when you're constantly rubbing up against thousands of people every day

Then don't rub up against them. I despise bodily contact with strangers I'm not having sex with. It plays havoc with my brain and I get extremely anxious if I get squeezed into a packed tube. This tends to lead to a lovely bout of depression later on. That's why I make sure I travel when it's not so busy, and take sensible routes to avoid the busy routes. Northern Line inbound (which I have experienced) is a bloodbath, so take it as far as Elephant and then switch lines or grab a bus.

It's similar with houses &amp; rent vs mortgaging. If you rent then the landlord is still paying off a mortgage plus paying for maintenance, repairs, management fees, etc ...while still making money. So renting is more expensive.

If you move a lot with work though or aren't planning on staying in the area for very long (less than 5-10 years) then renting is probably far more convenient so you may be willing to pay for that convenience.

Here is the real reasons we don't have enough GP's in the UK. Its called under funding.

He wouldn't be the 'fix' to problems, but he'll fit our playstyle much better than Lambert will. You say we need a mobile striker, well how don't Torres/Borini fufill that description? The difference between them is that Torres is historically a better goalscorer, and Brendan simply does not rate Borini at all. 

From all reports from Milan and Chelsea fans, his best (and at times only) attribute is his hardworking attitude and pressing ability. How does this differ from the mildly average Borini and Lambert?

Lambert has been horrid. I don't understand why you pluck stats from his last two seasons when he has done absolutely nothing in so many games this season. We can't play with a target man and even though fans say he's there for build up play by holding the ball up, I see it once or twice every game - the rest of the time, he's invisible. We're missing that player in front of the two central defenders, which Lambert just doesn't do. Our playstyle right now is to push the ball onto the wing and aimlessly cross it ala Man United last season, and we're just clueless in attack. Our only positives have been when we've smartly played one-twos and played quick little balls through, which is an environment Torres would do much better than Lambert in. 

The fact of the matter is, Brendan Rodgers is not going to be given much at all and from all reports his first priority is going to be a keeper. So, splitting his already meagre budget on two horrible players instead of a solid keeper like Begovic and a free transfer like Torres who fits our playstyle much better than Lambert and would only cost £10k p/w more than Borini for players of similar standard is just an astute transfer.

I believe the fixes to our problems lie in the goalkeeper position and the recovery of Flanagan, Sturridge and Balotelli. By selling Borini and getting a player who would actually play better than Lambert does for us, and would actually make the bench under Rodgers, it wouldn't be the signing to revolutionize our season, but rather one that would free up funds to strengthen our goalkeeping area.

Most students end up living in Lenton or Dunkirk. They're fairly average areas for Nottingham.

Yes, modern times means that there will always be a group of fans who will publicly call for the manager to be sacked soon as things turn sour even if we were unplayable just months ago, but you have to accept that.

He's a part of the committee. And FWIW I dont believe Pierce. Why did he come out now when Brendan is getting it from all sides? 

&gt; lack of planning: I have no idea where you are getting this from you will have to give me some sort of example

Selling Luis and replacing with nothing of similar or even near quality. Then last minute ' I had no option but Mario'. 

&gt; inability to show even a glimmer of tactical nous: absolute nonsense, Rodgers has changed formation and tactics all over the show and is regarded as one of the most modern and flexible coaches by his former players and staff (see Garry Monk for quotes). The worst part of this is that its perpetuated by Sam Allardyce, a guy who puts his team out to play by numbers (i.e. only shoot when within x yards of goal).

Right. But changing tactics and getting them right are 2 different things. The funny thing is Sam is flying high while Arsene and Rodgers.....I hate Sam FWIW, he;s a typical English bully from Fergusons gang who will gang with his old boys group, but it pains me to say he's right in saying that some managers wont twist. 

&gt; It's not a one off either look at Lucas this season, Rodgers has shown he is prepared to give players a chance contrary to this strange belief that he forces players out.

Excellent point forgetting that Lucas was last ditch measure. Before this we've been all thinking he;s gonners. He's using Lucas because he has no other sensible options and his defence and MF were getting their asses handed to them if not for Lucas. He doesnt have a choice, so let's not pretend about the Lucas situation.

Ironically, it helps only to promote UKIP. Some of the younger members of this subreddit might not be aware of this, but UKIP have been going for some twenty years, and until very recently, they were a bit of a nothing party, like all the other weird offshoots you see on your ballot papers. It's only with the arrival of Farage that the party started to get interesting, and it's only since the old media and general lefties have started talking extensively about them that their popularity has skyrocketed. 

It makes sense, if you think about it. Those random little parties you see on your ballot papers, when you've never heard of them, don't know anything about them, and have no idea what they stand for or are about, you're not going to vote for them. The party that you've heard all about though, and quietly agree with in various respects, they're the one you might end up voting for.

As someone who supports UKIP I like all the negative stories and tantamount obsession.  Especially those that think either UKIP has no policies or doesn't provide any solutions, only to then try to shut down any reasoned debate or to misrepresent policy.

It's all good fun, but when there's so little difference between the other parties and UKIP is at least forcing discussion or leaning on policy then people will discuss them, like them or loathe them.  And yes, the media and now people like Mr. Juncker chiming in all keeps them in the limelight.

The EU's planning another bailout in January as the EU is predicted to slip back into recession, so we may pass into a small Christmas lull but they'll be centre stage again come the New Year.   Pretty soon after that it's General Election season and manifestos will be coming out - so I doubt it's going anywhere for a while yet.

**Strategy One** (Networking). This is how it is going to be. You'd be surprised how many people start with menial jobs, get noticed because of their professionalism, and find their way into higher positions within a company.

One thing to consider is working for a larger organisation - there, while doing a menial job, you may have the occasional opportunity to network, get to know people in other departments, even socialise with other people inside that company. It is a great way to get known and be considered in the event another group gets desperate to fill a position but cannot find anybody suitable from outside the company in a hurry.

**Strategy Two** (Self-Study). Alternative strategies are to self-study *a lot*. Pick a topic. Be it gardening (if you're into gardens), cars, models, programming, networking, PC repair, sewing, hair cutting, or *whatever*. Visit your library (they do exist and they are free)! Get a membership card. Borrow 2-4 books on a single topic. Read them cover-to-cover.

The best way to really go forward in your career is to be *constantly self-teaching*. Every weekend you nerd-up and read a chapter about something *for the rest of your life*. When you're the authority on a topic, the go-to guy, then you aren't guaranteed a career - but you've got a hell of an edge on the other guy.

**Strategy Three** (Lie). Finally you could outright lie about your skills and talent. This has short term gains and successes. But if you're discovered - and you'll *probably* be discovered - you'll either become unemployable or, worse, contractually or criminally liable. This doesn't stop it from happening, there are plenty of stories of high level managers at companies like the BBC who faked it for years before being discovered.

I personally *strongly recommend* against lying in your career. If you don't know something, admit it. But be known for being that person that will go find out if you don't know something.",0,1418465087,null,0,false,0,cmtn06m,t3_2p5ccw,t1_cmtn06m,t3_2p5ccw,null,1425455495,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

While we're on the topic of misrepresenting critics towards UKIP, I'd like to mention a few anecdotes myself. 

I've seen plenty of times where kippers have tried to shut down discussion by using underhand tactics. Plenty of times I've criticised UKIP for showing bigoted views, only for people to ignore that and call me some sort of looney-lefty who only dislikes them because of the Australian immigration system. Around the Rotherham by-election, if you had the gall to not support UKIP, you'd be labelled as a politically correct paedophile enabler. 

When kippers have shown time and time again, both in the press and on forums like reddit that they are unwilling to engage with criticism outside of arguing about their strawmen of the EU and immigration, that they are unwilling to recognise legitimate complains about UKIP that they themselves make about other parties, it seems pretty rich for you to make a comment like that.

If anything it's going to mushroom, and I'm not just assuming that they'l get the result they want (although I'm absolutely sure the 'out' platform will secure an exit).   

Hypothetically if they were to lose, and remember that any such campaign wouldn't be UKIP run but a rainbow coalition of cross party politicians more like Better Off Out or Business for Britain, or even The Freedom Association or Bruges Group, but if they were to lose what is the message we have learned from the Scottish referendum?

The SNP were the one party uniformly for leaving the union.  They lost a popular vote but coalesced the independence voters away from other parties around them.   The SNP haven't shut up despite losing.  They're on track to whitewash the opposition in May. 

With near certainty we're heading to a hung parliament where UKIP will win MPs, both leading in some constituencies and now qualifying for the tactical vote by being the effective party of opposition in other parts of the country.  They're certainly not going to shut up then.

If it's a hung parliament then there's nothing to say in the Cameron 'promise' that there'd be a referendum, so they'll definitely not shut up then, especially if Federalists continue with their intention to launch a federal law proposal at the start of 2017.

Then if they get a referendum the Scottish lesson is that win or lose, they're still not going to be shutting up.

The closest thing the country has to somehow taking heat out of the UKIPian engine room in terms of Shutting Up is if there's a Conservative leadership challenge and they put a real Eurosceptic in charge, someone like David Davis - and even then he's likely to use UKIP rather than to silence them, but they'd be less relevant.",0,1418467437,null,0,1418467703,0,cmtndry,t3_2p4yod,t1_cmtndry,t1_cmtkomo,null,1425455319,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

All questions that count will be related to the subject you're studying, any 'weird' ones that have no relation whatsoever to NatSci (like the famous 'describe this banana' one) will not be asked. 

Try practicing some curve sketching, typically in Maths interviews it's a very popular question. Pay attention to behaviour around zero, if and where axes are crossed and turning points/points of inflection. 

Your personal statement probably won't be the biggest part of either interview, but know it well. If you said you've read something, you won't need to know it off by heart but should maybe be able to talk about some things raised by it.

The only thing I know for certain is that there is a committee and that it is deliberately targeting young players. Beyond that it is just speculation as to how much say Rodgers has.
 
&gt; Selling Luis and replacing with nothing of similar or even near quality. Then last minute ' I had no option but Mario'.

He didn't have a choice with selling Luis really and he went after Sanchez and lost out, went after Remy but something was clearly wrong there. We couldn't get our targets, but Rodgers doesn't negotiate the fee or advise on medical risks so I don't see how we can lay the blame at his doorstep.

&gt;Right. But changing tactics and getting them right are 2 different things. The funny thing is Sam is flying high while Arsene and Rodgers.....I hate Sam FWIW, he;s a typical English bully from Fergusons gang who will gang with his old boys group, but it pains me to say he's right in saying that some managers wont twist.

I'm struggling to argue this point so maybe you are right, although Rodgers is willing to try a lot of things to see what works 

&gt;Excellent point forgetting that Lucas was last ditch measure. Before this we've been all thinking he;s gonners. He's using Lucas because he has no other sensible options and his defence and MF were getting their asses handed to them if not for Lucas.

To be fair none of us expected Lovren to be as poor as he was, more importantly I don't think we expected the goals to dry up nearly as quickly as they did.

* This is finally seen as a catalyst to fix our broken voting system and replace with something at least slightly proportional, in which case UKIP will remain a political force and a Tory-UKIP coalition could be possible in the future (which I wouldn't want but at least it would be giving the people what they want, which is the point of democracy).

I agree that UKIP aren't going away anytime soon.

No - so everything else you said was a complete waste of time.

If anything that 32 billion combined figure is most likely a massive understatement. Unlike Benefit fraud stats, there are many studies showing a much higher rate of fraud and avoidance than the government reports. In such studies, Tax Evasion is understood as being taxes avoided through the use of legal schemes not available to the general public - for example, creating a company in Jersey that takes all the money you earn before tax and pays you a capital sum taxed at capital gains only or transferring revenue intercompany to minimise tax payments. Not ISAs or tax free allowances.

So as someone looking in from outside, let's just assume that it's the fault of every member? Rodgers is a solid part of that committee. And I refuse to believe that after refusing a DoF, he would take on the the targets of the committee without a word. He wouldnt. 

&gt; He didn't have a choice with selling Luis really 

Fair, I'm not saying he could do more to keep him anyway.

&gt; he went after Sanchez and lost out, went after Remy but something was clearly wrong there. We couldn't get our targets, but Rodgers doesn't negotiate the fee or advise on medical risks so I don't see how we can lay the blame at his doorstep.

Fair again. When you know Sanchez is dragging his heels, why not go after a similar player? Madzukic, Martinez etc. would be what we needed. We had the money, we knew the level we were looking for. Why then compromise with someone like Remy and then Mario? My point being that the time wastes over Sanchez once we knew he was dragging his heels could have been used better.

&gt;   be fair none of us expected Lovren to be as poor as he was, more importantly I don't think we expected the goals to dry up nearly as quickly as they did. ***And why does it matter if Lucas was last ditch or not?*** He made the decision to play him and it worked whereas in the past it stagnated our play.

I brought this up since you said he's willing to give a chance to players. It was more in desperation than a willingness to give a chance is what I'm seeing. Yes, once he made his mark, Rodgers had to drop Allen, that much I can give him.

Paul Staines, or Guido of order-order and Spectator fame, as a guest speaker proposed a coming together of UKIP and Conservatives at a UKIP YI conference.  They laughed/booed him on the stage.  It's unsellable.

And what purpose does it serve?  UKIP are going into Labour heartlands where Tories can't tread.  They're not going to abandon that.

Why would even the Conservatives want them to abandon that?     
No, there might be a ceasefire.  There might even be cooperation, but there won't be a union now.  They've left it far too late, and Cameron, Clarke and even Hague have created too much ill will.

Even Lord Ashcroft noted that in Ed Miliband's own constituency the Conservatives are poorly placed, but if they encouraged Conservative voters to vote UKIP (which they could do indirectly by not putting forward a candidate or limiting campaigning outside open endorsement) and UKIP could deny Labour seats and make a Conservative led  government more likely.

&gt;UKIP will continue to be the third party in British politics for the foreseeable future, but never gain any power e.g. become the new Lib Dems (before 2010).

Likely but, they'll force debates and get bills through.  They're already forcing debates now and molding even the policies of others.

&gt;This is finally seen as a catalyst to fix our broken voting system and replace with something at least slightly proportional,

Which is in itself a UKIP policy, so 2 and 3 are pretty much the same.

&gt; I actually think if there were a referendum and we did vote to leave, this would dent UKIPs support as leaving the EU is the main reason people vote for them.

Perhaps, but not for at least another 5 years, possibly 10.

There's so much work to done after a referendum, and then after an exit - and they're the ones with a vision and policy outside the EU.  They'd be relevant for some time to come.

If there is a UKIP breakthrough as the third UK party they'll open the door for other smaller, minority parties to become electable.  The DUP, SNP, Greens, PC, will all become more relevant - as will independents.  Protest groups, let alone parties will have more representation.

And if another referendum promise is seen to be broken then there will be real grounds for a cross support Citizen's Initiative Bill, and as assuredly as night follows day if that passes then there will be more proportional representation in the pipeline.

false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"""Local rate"" made sense when BT and other companies charged for a call based on distance - it meant that calling a company in London cost the same as calling your next door neighbour, rather than the much more expensive national rate (unless you live in or near London of course).

But that style of charging ended at least 10 years ago, and companies persisted in using 0845 numbers and calling them ""local rate"" (or 0870 and ""national rate"") when they actually cost far more and the concept of local/national rate didn't really exist. Eventually they were told to actually advertise it as ""it will cost x per minute to call from a BT landline"" 

It's only recently that Ofcom has decided to act on it by cutting the costs of calling these numbers, removing any profit share (companies used to get a substantial part of the rate you paid, so they profited from keeping you in queues) and introducing the 03xx code which is the same cost to call as any landline (or inclusive in any calling package or mobile tariff).

So it makes more sense to call them premium rate - they aren't £1.50 a minute like true premium rate, but they cost a lot more to call than a landline (especially from a mobile phone).

Next Ofcom needs to act on the 070xx scam - numbers that look like mobile phone numbers but aren't, and can cost far more (something like 50p/min at its worst) with no warning or announcement to tell you that.

I've given an idea [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/2p5ccw/change_my_life_what_jobs_are_in_demand_that_pay/cmtnt69) of how you could move up from your current position, obviously you could veer off into jobs like coding and waiting list management (if that's a seperate thing to a med. sec. where you work) if they interest you more.

You could also consider working your way up in retail.  Shop staff &gt; supervisor &gt; assistant manager &gt; store manager &gt; area manager.  Be very honest with yourself about it though. Retail looks easy, in part because so many weekend staff are teenagers, but if you want to work your way up expect long hours, hard work, and dealing with a lot of bullshit from both customers and the aforementioned teenaged weekend staff.  You need a particular type of personality to be good at retail, and it's fairly competitive.  Look for a small to medium sized national chain and get yourself a reputation as an all-round hard worker.  You'll probably need your manager to like you.

You can have a look at lists of occupations where there are shortages; google is your friend here.  They're going to fall broadly into the areas of engineering, health and social care, and arts &amp; entertainment, although arts and entertainment is things like professional dancers and musicians, the kind of thing you'd've been training for since you were a child.  There are also teacher shortages, particularly for subjects like maths and science.

Most of those shortage occupations, as I'm sure you've noticed, require some sort of further education or training, most of them at least an undergraduate degree.  If the thought of three or four years of student lifestyle doesn't appeal to you, have you considered something like the Open University?  It has the advantage of being flexible so you can fit it around your current lifestyle, and you don't need to have high grades in your chosen field of study.

Yes but these people don't generally attribute these problems to either immigration or the EU. Also elderly people isn't the demographic. People born before we joined the EEC is the demographic. It isn't that they are elderly alone. It is that the prime eurosceptic generation are now amongst the age group mostly likely to vote. Hence this is peak UKIP.

Look keep posting the emotional wishy washy stuff if you wish. Actual electoral surveys have consistently shown that the vast bulk of UKIP support owns a bus pass. Even their great surges in support have continued to come from the elderly. The people in Labour areas who now vote UKIP have previously voted for James Callaghan.

&gt;In 2010 I wouldn't have thought the British gov be going to court to stop British people marrying who they want

Arranged marriages of convenience for visas were going on long before 2010, and they were treated like scams then too.   

If you're talking about genuine marriage but needing to see if people can support themselves, then they're the party of increased personal allowance, and which can significantly reduce the cost of living (energy, food, housing, tax) so governments don't have to consider such options.

&gt;They're doing that. If there's a UKIP/Tory coalition I wouldn't be surprised if this gets worse.

The chances of there being a UKIP Tory coaltion are unbelievably slim.  Like crazy slim.   If it's Cameron still in power it's nil.  It would be a career ending crush for Cameron.

&gt;Both Labour and the Tories are doubling down on the rhetoric.

Because they can't deliver controlled immigration.

The only party that can is UKIP on leaving the EU.  It would actually then be a much fairer and equal immigration policy.

&gt;Social provision is going down hill from all the parties. In about 5 years we're going to be looking at massive restriction on what will be provided in terms of education and other things. That's across the political spectrum.

So you have a problem with the party that wants more school places, to scrap tuition fees, to promote single exam boards?

Social provision and yet the one party that can reduce the cost of both energy and food?

&gt;I'm an ex management consultant, current academic so I have options to go elsewhere and provide the same quality of life without being told that I'm not wanted here. 

Who has told you that?   You'd be welcome to remain (presuming you're currently legally here) and if you're skilled in in-demand fields you'd actively be head hunted!

&gt;Being treated like I'm scum for the colour of my skin and without having to worry about whether my parents are going to safe.

Yeah, and that's not UKIP.  That's BNP.  Big difference.  UKIP has nothing to do with ethnicity

I'm sure your parents would be even more safe.  UKIP is traditionally the ones that are tough on crime.

&gt;A lot of my colleagues are either the same as me, or are in couples that are immigrant and British, or are second or third generation immigrants.

So they're all good too, then.    

&gt;The environment just isn't conducive to sticking around , especially when you've got places around the world willing to offer you tenure plus for a lot less effort.

If you want to stay, stay.  If you want to go, go, but it doesn't sound like you're remotely making an informed decision.   It sounds like you've taken much of your understanding about UKIP in forums like this one - and it's hardly reflective.

It is true that it is very easy these days to move around the world even if you're not in a political union, which is why it is important to be competitive and to broaden vistas.   In a nutshell that is what UKIP is actually about.  They believe we're big enough to leave a protectionist EU customs union and that it's time to shake off over burdensome regulations and policy and become globally more competitive.

&gt;I love being here. I came back from a high-flying international career because I love it here.

Great, then do stay.

&gt;But, my country really doesn't seem to be a place that won't want me soon.

Which is blatantly not true, of it, or the party which is attracting your ire.   

&gt; It's really sad that I'm even having to think about it.

You're only thinking about it because you're misinformed about it.  You've swallowed some anti-rhetoric wholesale, fueled in no small part by the two parties that have always held power who are now shitting themselves because apparently there's no such thing as a party safe seat in the traditional sense anymore.

-------------------------

This party that you're worried about and their take on immigration...

- The leader married an immigrant (German).  

- The deputy leader was an immigrant (Spain).   

- Their healthcare spokesperson is the daughter of an immigrant (Dutch).    

- Their chief whip married an immigrant (Asian - Malaysian I think)

- Their regulations and immigration spokesperson is mixed ethnicity his family were immigrants (Caribbean)

- Their EFDD media guy, married an Asian lady has mixed race kids.   

- Communities spokesperson is an immigrant (Pakistan)

- Head of Policy - son of an immigrant (Turkey)    

- A newly elected MP was himself an immigrant (Kenya, Uganda, Africa in general)  

- Their agriculture spokesman was an immigrant and served in the Rhodesian army.

- Their housing spokesman is a British Greek-Cypriot.

Now either they're a party that hates their own mums and dads, their own children, their own husbands and wives, or you might have misplaced fears about their take on immigration.

Let's start with the basics.  Did you know they support net immigration but to extend opportunities to those outside the EU, not favour the EU above others, and as such become more ethnically diverse?",0,1418473709,null,0,1418474022,0,cmtodox,t3_2p4yod,t1_cmtodox,t1_cmto19s,null,1425454854,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

The fact is, I do think UKIP are an awful and nasty party. This isn't because of their views on mass-immigration and the EU. It is because of how Farage has spouted his views on privatising the NHS, and not really explained how within in a year he has radically changed that view; how he makes discriminatory comments against people from Eastern Europe as if they're job-stealing benefit-thieving bogeymen; how he has constantly misrepresented the facts, like using statistics on non-British children in British schools to suggest non-integration, when his own daughters would be counted among their number. 

It is because of how Amjad Bashir has suggested he supports scrapping things like maternity leave and holiday entitlement, then redacting those views from his website weeks before the European elections, with no explanation of why his views changed so radically. 

It is because of how Paul Nuttall has suggested he supports privatising the NHS, then redacted those views from his website without any explanation of why his views changed so radically. 

It is because of how Godfrey Bloom was allowed to spend years embarrassing both himself and his country in the European Parliament, calling German MEPs Nazis and sexually harassing women, before finally being sacked only after months of press coverage. 

It is because of how Roger Helmer has tried to excuse rapists by suggesting certain women ask for it, how he has attacked homosexuals, and how he supported NHS privatisation, then silenced those views without any explanation of why his views changed so radically. 

And it is how UKIP, instead of dealing with these issues and many others, try to push the blame onto the media and political elite, or try to hide it by suggesting that people only disagree with them because of their views on mass-immigration and the EU.",0,1418473824,null,0,false,0,cmtoeed,t3_2p4yod,t1_cmtoeed,t1_cmto4w0,null,1425454844,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Logical fallacy, begging the question. It's also nonsense because their economic policy lives in a fantasy land where less taxation and more cutting somehow delivers more provision.  And no the exit from the EU isn't going to cover that.

Insurance companies don't look at individual drivers all that much - the no claims bonus is about all they do there.

What's important is the statistics for lots of policies.  

If they insured a hundred people like you, they made £125,000 revenue. But then one fuckwit had to go and ruin it all by crashing into a personal injury lawyer driving around in a £200,000 Ferrari. By the time it was all settled, the amount paid out was around £300,000.

At the end of the year, the statistics show that for drivers like you they lost £175,000. Shit. Offering you a policy for £1250 was an expensive mistake. And yes, this sort of thing does happen occasionally - insurance is basically a big company gambling with their policyholders money; some they win, some they lose.

Of course, you don't know about the fuckwit and the Ferrari.

Are you as vociferous about tax fraud/evasion?

Can you link to a post where you have demanded that ~~people~~ social parasites like Rupert Murdoch should be prosecuted (and jailed) for their deliberate lies, bribes, excuses, and scams used to avoid paying the dues that they *owe* society?

Christ on a bike! It looks like you are willing to hang people who make genuine mistakes about relatively small amounts of benefits claimed in error, what would your sanctions be for people deliberately defrauding the exchequer of £billions?

What about Google, Amazon, et al?

They and those like them are the *real* parasites, they bribe politicians with promises of seats on the board etc after retirement, and we end up with a situation where because of graft the corporations don't pay even a fraction of what they should, they gain all the benefits of our society without putting in their fair dues, and there's somehow no harm, no foul! 

In fact the cocaine-fuelled-chancellor currently incumbent in number 11 is giving them *more* tax breaks, because they're his old school/uni chums and as I posted earlier nepotism, cronyism, kickbacks, profiteering and greed demonstrably abound.

Osborn inveigled £80billion from the British people and gave it to his chums the bankers, they paid out £81 billion in bonuses!

Not wages, **bonuses** *presumably* for having caused ""Austerity*""!

That is fucking obscene.

And if you don't stand against it, you are clearly as immoral and corrupt as those that practice it.

That's why I (for one) stand against it.

*Austerity: Austerity is when you tighten your own belt, by choice. When it's inflicted from above it's feudal tribute, to the nobility/elite.

Brand certainly has substance, he seems to be the only one speaking out about these issues that the media picks up on (which really raises its own questions), and he doesn't need to be a politician to have value.

     ""presuming you're currently legally here""

I presumed you were legally here.  You really are coming across as hysterical and unhinged now - or you need to calm down to a level where you can read.

&gt;I've done 30 years plus of having to deal with racism, watching my friends deal with racism, watching the beast travel from one political rest home to another.

And I sympathise for you, but that's nothing to do with the party you're attacking.

&gt;My personal background is detailed study of history all the way to degree level. A background in philosophy covering over 20 years of my life, both while working and being in academia.

&gt;Seriously. I'm misinformed?
 
About this, yes.   You appear to have a very poor understanding of current affairs and modern politics.  You certainly have a poor understanding of the party you're attacking, or their policy.


&gt;They're not scams. I've already owned ededmilliband on this.. don't make me whip you as well.

LOL!   I'm not saying all arranged marriages are scams, but there's certainly some visa based scams involved in it.

&gt;Logical fallacy, begging the question. It's also nonsense because their economic policy lives in a fantasy land where less taxation and more cutting somehow delivers more provision. And no the exit from the EU isn't going to cover that.

It's not begging the question, it was asking the question.   You said you thought education was going to go down hill - I asked if you were basing that off more school places, scrapping tuition fees, or single exam boards, both of which seem reasonable policies to improve education.  

They've already explained how they scrap tuition fees and costed it out in Doncaster.  They don't have to use the money spent of EU membership contributions.   

But as for making more money outside the EU, yes, it MORE than covers it and much more:  

How much does the 
        European Union cost Britain?  by Professor Tim Congdon   

        The UK is roughly 11½% of GDP – about £185 billion 
        a year – worse-off because it is a member of the EU 
        instead of being a fully-independent sovereign nation.
        The main reason for this heavy cost is the damage 
        that excessive and misguided regulation is doing to 
        British business, particularly to small-and-medium-sized
        businesses that cannot cope with the paperwork 
        and restrictions.

http://www.timcongdon4ukip.com/docs/EU2014.pdf

11½% of a trillion pound economy is a lot of cheddar.   Tim Congdon was one of the so called Wise Men brought in to advise Ken Clarke on economics after Black Wednesday. 

&gt;And so what? Their rhetoric is anti-immigrant,

Nope, pro-controlled immigration.

&gt;xenophobic

Definitely not.  They want a relationship based on trade with the EU and to throw itself into the wider world outside the Common External Tariff.  More globaal cooperation and greater links with the wider world.  A much more equal based immigration policy too for all countries irrespective of or

&gt;and harmful to relations between people.

They promote integration, not multiculturalism that isolates itself.

&gt;So some of them happen to be immigrants, the results of their actions and the knowing use of bitterness as rhetoric is going to lead to a more fractured and xenophobic country. 

You're the one sounding like a bigot...

But seriously, you definitely need to calm down.  You are informed, and no, having a degree in history or studying philosophy doesn't mean you can't be uninformed.

Cabaye -  Hells Yeah. He is a player that was brilliant to watch at Newcastle, and it's just a shame PSG have such ridiculous quality in midfield, because Cabaye could still be useful there, but if he were going relatively cheaply you better believe he'd be a great signing.  

Vejinovic - Looked interesting, similar possibly to Tadic, although maybe a bit deeper or something? Our injuries at present are why we look so short in midfield, although realistically we're not.

The immigration debate has ALWAYS been about race. The stupidity of the Labour government was not to be able to decouple it from the idea of race and try have it both ways. Look like they were opening immigration up but also pandering to the Daily Mail by effectively tangling up the whole immigration system with daft regulation 

[Margaret Thatcher was saying this sort of stuff in the 1970s](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/margaret-thatcher/6906503/Margaret-Thatcher-complained-about-Asian-immigration-to-Britain.html)

&gt;criticism doesn't apply to all immigrants/Muslims, but to just those doing the poor behaviour. 

This is bollocks. UKIP have a large Islamphobic contingent and it runs deep within the party 

"" Almost half of the Ukip affiliates in our survey ranked either immigration or Muslims in Britain as the most important issues facing Britain today. Over half (51%) rejected the suggestion that Britain has benefited from diversity. Almost two-fifths (37%) backed the idea of repatriating immigrants back to their country of origin, and irrespective of whether they had broken the law. Over three-fifths (64%) would feel ""bothered a lot"" by the presence of an Islamic institution in their community, which is over twice the national average (31%). And 85% of them disagreed with the suggestion that Islam does not pose a danger to the west, while the equivalent figure among the BNP group was only three points higher.""

The 11% on the EU is taken as things presently stand. With a decline in oil prices, the slowing of global growth, lowered tax receipts and renegotiated rates on every trade agreement that we hold with the EU,  Also the re-negotiation of treaties with everyone else because of our agreements to take out the EU components, there is NO WAY we're bringing in 11% after leaving the EU. You're lucky if you break even. 

At 1930s level of expenditure on social provision, and a zero saving on leaving the EU - that's a collapse of service provision right there. This is before we go anywhere near discussing the impact of Nissan, BMW and others re-evaluating their Net Present Value and giving us a higher risk premium on the gearing ratios they use for project.  An IRR of 10% goes up to 13% on a new investment - see good bye to that project coming here.

It frankly baffles me that the media have turned on Brendan Rodgers so drastically following a period of significant over-achievement; Liverpool should never have come so close to the title last season against such stout competition, but with Rodgers they did. Now, your whole squad has been overhauled - while literally all of your rivals have strengthened - and suddenly everyone is surprised that Liverpool's performance has dropped off significantly. They shouldn't be.

At the end of last season, I anticipated - and I'm sure a lot of you did too - that Suarez and Sturridge would be unlikely to replicate their career defining form. 52 goals and 19 assists is an absurd level of production for two Premier League strikers, and I imagined that there would be some degree of regression coming into this season. What I didn't predict, however, was that 100% of that production would just disappear completely.

You've lost Suarez to Barcelona and Sturridge to injury. No club at any level can lose those kind of players without any adverse effects to their performance. None. Doesn't matter who the manager is. This problem is worsened by the fact that Steven Gerrard has regressed from one of the most productive central-midfielders in the league into someone who is struggling with the limitations that come with age. Rodgers has been unlucky, the nucleus of his squad has fallen victim at least in some capacity to transfer, injury and decline. Even Martin Skyrtel doesn't look likely to replicate his 7 goals in the league last season.

How does Rodgers mitigate those losses? How does he rejuvenate the side and sustain the form of last season?

Well, working with significant financial limitations, Liverpool were able to use the Suarez money and some change to add depth at numerous positions. Can, Markovic and Moreno are all high-upside players below the age of 25, with the ability to develop long-term and provide stability at several positions. Liverpool have seen this strategy work when purchasing players like Coutinho and Sturridge, and clearly they wanted to pursue something similar here.

In recent years, the club has struggled to attract a marquee signing like Di Maria or Sanchez, and even if they could, Suarez was in a league of his own last season; they could never replace him like-for-like. Therefore Liverpool bought an old plough-horse, Lambert, on the cheap in the hope that he might be able to contribute 10+ goals in the league like he did last season. They also bought - again, on the cheap - Balotelli. Say what you want about his woeful early season form, it made sense for Liverpool to make a gamble on a player who is still young, still has bags of natural talent, and who might be able to revive his career with the right set-up and guidance. It was a gamble that, at this point, looks to have failed, but again, it would be near impossible for Liverpool to find the same obvious potential upside at that price-point.

Your real mistake was to purchase Lallana and Lovren, who were horribly over-priced and over-valued on the basis of a single promising season at Southampton - and even then, Lallana has looked strong even if he most likely wasn't worth the lofty fee.

The point is this: sensible decision-making can often result in poor outcomes. The fact that your summer transfers have been disappointing thus-far is not an indictment of the processes behind those signings. Liverpool will need to address over the next few seasons whether to instate a Director of Football, who can have autonomous control over transfer dealings and can commit to long-term development, or whether to give Rodgers greater control; let him choose the players he's comfortable working with and go from there. Pointing the finger squarely at Rodgers and blaming him for your summer transfer dealings is both reactionary and misguided.

Rodgers is a very good manager. He's not a tactical genius, but he's an excellent motivator, he has a commitment to developing youth, he's willing to take risks and play attacking football, and he's only 41. He belongs to Liverpool for as long as they want to keep him.

If I had any interest in the club - and it's pretty clear that I don't - I would want Rodgers to take Liverpool forward with a singular vision that can build and develop for years and years rather than go back to the managerial carousel that you've struggled with for so long. The likes of Benitez, Hodgson, Dalgleish? They've all had the same problems and worse. Getting rid of yet another manager is not going to solve your problems, it will only compound them.

For a single season, I'm sure that the likes of Mourinho would elevate Liverpool's season in a way that Rodgers won't be able to. But in terms of having a manager who is capable of building the club around them, developing it with the long-term in mind, and adopting a philosophy that works, Brendan Rodgers is right; he's probably the best man for the job right now.

Last season, Rodgers proved that if you get the right tools for him to work with, he can take you to the very top. You've just got to trust that he can get you back there.

The implication is that the Silents are scavengers and parasites - living off other species without them even knowing. They stole the ship from whichever species designed them in The Lodger.

Though that doesn't really explain why it looks so TARDIS-y.

&amp;nbsp;

edit:
Actually I've just read this on the TARDIS wiki:

&gt;In Day of the Moon, the Doctor mentions the ship was ""abandoned,"" despite the fact that he saw the pilot's body and even heard from the on-board emergency system that the ship had crashed and the pilot had died, possibly further evidence of the details being erased from his memory. Also, the corpse's hands possessed four fingers, just as the Silence do.

I think it suggests it is the *same* ship and originally belonged to the Silents, which later crash landed in The Lodger. So for the ship, The Lodger is set *after* Day of the Moon.

That would help out our forwards as we would be going from having an only one incisive striker who is hurt constantly that can stretch a defense, to having 3 players who can roam across the front line and wreak havoc to defenses. 
      

I think our midfield would do well to find a long term solution to replace stevie, someone who can play alongside lucas and still be a threat offensively (joe allen as tidy as he is simply does not offer anything going forward) or simply blood in Emre Can rather than go out and find another potential first teamer. We have talented wide players in Sterling and Markovic and Lallana can play there as well, I am hoping we can get Suso to become a solid first team/sub player in the near future giving us quality and depth without having to buy someone new.
     
 
Back 4, we are set for Rb (if we can hold onto Manquillo and Flanno), Lb we may need to find someone who is a bit more apt defensively than moreno as it seems like enrique is constantly injured. I do believe we need another CB as kolo (even as solid as he has been) is getting on in years, maybe we should have a look at Davide Astori from cagliari. If we can pair Sahko (please Rodgers dont be daft and let him leave the club) with Lovren/ Skertel/Astori and have a competent defensive mid fielder in front of them I think that may help us leaking so many goals.


Finally I do think we need to have competition for Migs, alot of the top teams have rotating goalies and as nice as Brad Jones's hair maybe, he simply is not good enough to challenge for the number 1 spot. Maybe we should pay the money and get Leno or maybe Muslera to give Migs rotation and let the better keeper play in the league and leave other for the cup/ euro games.
      

While none of these players are ""big name"" players they are all well established stars in their relative leagues and are known as big talents in their relatively smaller clubs. I think selling borini, johnson and maybe even enrique we would have to spend maybe 40 million pounds to add solid known quality rather than relatively unknown players for the future who may or may not pan out.


Finally while potentially adding players and making first team changes (stop playing henderson out wide or one forward formations with static strikers or play with sterling as a striker as he gets physically dominated by big CBs) it really is down to BR how to best configure the team. This is how I would line up our team if we bought a few of these players while playing 2 strikers.

I hope you don't teach them politics or reading comprehension because your understanding is poor on both counts.

Teaching execs doesn't make you informed on all matters, and I'm surprised you are pursuing this erroneous line of defence.   

You have displayed a very poor understanding of politics, and more specifically next to no understanding of UKIP.

&gt;The 11% on the EU is taken as things presently stand. With a decline in oil prices, the slowing of global growth, lowered tax receipts and renegotiated rates on every trade agreement that we hold with the EU

You didn't read it, did you.  I know you didn't because it is primarily based on regulation of SMEs, and implementation of that regulation.   

You just provided a load of flannel as misdirection.  You're going to have to read it.   

Read it?  I don't think you even opened it.  I don't see how you could have gotten it so spectacularly wrong if you had.

&gt; Also the re-negotiation of treaties with everyone else because of our agreements to take out the EU components, there is NO WAY we're bringing in 11% after leaving the EU. You're lucky if you break even.

Again, you're thinking as if it is trade. It's not.  You're going to have to read it.

&gt;At 1930s level of expenditure on social provision,

Or Japanese-Austalian levels of expenditure to put it in a less neurotic way...

&gt;and a zero saving on leaving the EU...

You studied history.  You're arguing with Professor Tim Congdon one of the country's economic wise men that helped turn the country around and balanced the budget post Black Wednesday.

&gt;that's a collapse of service provision right there. 

Or you could do that other thing and streamline putting more resources into frontline services for less.

&gt;This is before we go anywhere near discussing the impact of Nissan, BMW and others re-evaluating their Net Present Value and giving us a higher risk premium on the gearing ratios they use for project.

Oh, how like the EU paid for Ford to move from the UK to set up outside the EU in Turkey?  Or how Landrover is sending production outside the grips of EU carbon tax?  Or how the aluminium industry is saying that it is untenable to reinvest in the EU with its forced energy increases, with the Commissioner for Industry having even warned that they face an 'industrial massacre'?

Or shall we focus on that Nissan said the exact same thing about joining the Euro, spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt, and *HOW WRONG THEY WERE!*
 
&gt;Not really, it's anti-immigrant. They emphasis EU immigration for now.

No, it is really, really pro-net immigration.   You just weren't informed, and you were apparently getting confused with your parties:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO22-FW5Qdc
 
They want a more equal immigration system applied equally to all - far more equal than what it is as part of the European Union.

You just linked to a potential candidate that was banned from the party for talking against Islam, whilst your UKIP MEP for Yorkshire that was elected in the same election period, is a devout Muslim.  *You're actually arguing that a nobody who was running at council level, who was promptly banned from the party, is indicative of the party and the party line!*  That's just dishonest on your part.  

Talking about religious slaughter banning isn't anti-Muslim, it's pro-animal rights if anything.  As it turns out they sent their agricultural spokesman who sits on the agricultural committee, himself a professional farmer, to inspect religious slaughter abattoirs.  He found that they were professionally run and banning religious slaughter is not a policy.


The voluntary charter of understanding calling for a declaration by moderate imams,  to specifically reduce tensions post 7/7 and to reaffirm British identity, was actually adopted by the British Muslim Council.   Imams and community leaders voluntarily signed an open letter of declaration and then ran the IslamisPeace.org.uk to promote [INTEGRATION](http://imgur.com/DCzc8se)!  

The campaign 'Proud to be a British Muslim' was a leaf taken straight out of the UKIP proposal of voluntary reaffirmation.

Your UKIP MEP, has worked as a successful local Muslim business man for the Princes Trust to promote integration and community cohesion.  He's actually doing something.  Who's the one sewing division here?  It's you!

&gt;Is this about EU immigration?

It's about not trusting Labour to run local servies, saying there are 1,400 reasons not to trust Labour.  The incumbent Labour MP himself admits he could have done more.

It's about 1,400 boys and girls being sexually abused and the authorities utterly letting them down.

This isn't just misinformed anymore, it's deliberately obtuse.   

But please don't tell me again that you must be informed on all matters because you studied history and have worked with some CEOs - because it's transparently obvious it has nothing to do with what we're discussing and that your background knowledge is inadequate.

My brother tells me it is still full of Townies, though they may be less violent these days, what with all the CCTV that got put in in the late 80s. When I was still there, a mate went to London for university. When he got back we had a really illustrative conversation:

""How's London? Is it as rough as they say?""

""Nope. It's not rough at all. I've been out every week since I went down and haven't seen a single fight.""

""... er... really?""

""Yeah.""

""So.. when you say you went out... that wasn't like pubs and stuff right? Parties and mates' houses yeah?""

""No. Pubs and clubs. Every week. Never seen a single fight.""

We were all pretty stunned. If he hadn't been a mate we simply wouldn't have believed him. The simple fact is that if you want to feel threatened and/or get in an actual fight, walk around Northampton Town Centre between 10:50 and 11:20. You'll certainly get a bit of agro if you're on your own and not wearing whatever ""uniform"" the townies have decided to wear that year. If you give any back, then that's likely a fight. If you're with a bunch of mates, you're fine. If you avoid the town centre, you're fine.

But yeah: pretty much every week there would be something kicking off in a pub, burger bar, or on the street. You might not see it but it'd be happening at some point in the night, somewhere. I never used to go out: mainly for that reason. The Racehorse was a good pub, though, just outside the centre. Then a few more nice ones opened up outside of town and we had options after that.

I'm not too fussed over where I study. It's just this year I missed out on an excellent opportunity because I didn't have a 2:1 degree. That said, attending a Russell Group university would be nice.

I've heard of access courses before and I've done some further research on them. It'd definitely be cheaper and easier than paying for A-Levels. However, my main problem is all the local colleges within a ~50 mile radius do not allow for part-time or evening study. They all require a minimum of 4 days in college p/w. 

I'd be able to leave my job for university but it would be a struggle to leave my job and attend college for 4 days p/w over the course of a year.

Constantly refurbishing ageing property is an albatross around any social housing portfolio.  Refurbishing an old property is money you can't spend on providing new property, and it then ties up your assets.  Sit on it by all means and keep tenants making a minimum-to-reasonable contribution whilst the property's price matures, but once the area is developed and attracting investment cash in and move on and develop somewhere else more run down or tired.

Shared equity is one of the few things Labour got right in the last government.  Provide affordable housing, allow people to get on the property ladder so even if they only own a tenth if they decide to buy or sell they still have a deposit on a property and not all their rent has disappeared.

Reward councils that develop a property, constantly refresh their housing portfolios, and which produce turnaround.  Allow them to retain more of their profits to reinvest.

That way if you see a council investing in social housing and shared equity programmes in a certain area you'd know that when they come on the market in 10 years there'd be private investment in the area.  It's a boon to local business.  Councils could be a catalyst to private investment, whereas traditional council estates often became sink estates and moved private investment elsewhere.

false,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I am more informed than you. You're welcome to cruise through my comments and find out for yourself. I did a politics degree and happen to work at three unis as an associate teaching management. So, yes, that's two decade or more politics, philosophy and economics.

You obviously don't understand the arguments about economics, when you talk about SMEs after quoting a our GDP figure, or you've not udnerstood your own source. GDP is a cumulative macro measure. SME regulation is a cumulative input to GDP but are a calculation of transaction cost or opportunity cost saved by estimation.  Tariffs and project costs are direct costs. Tax receipts are dependent on the overall interaction and gearing when it comes GDP. 

Even if SME's save transaction costs or opportunity costs due to deregulation. The offset is the cost of trade in tariffs AND the risk premium on the projects. 

You obviously don't know what an IRR is or a Net Present Value is, you'd understand what I'm talking about. The IRR is the Internal Rate of Return. A company will gear project funding using this and to estimate the return on the project. Look it up.  Every business will add to their IRR if we leave the EU. That means projects get canned. 

Obviously this is why my teaching at MBA level is important, because this is what we talk about. It's also what I did as a consultant. 

Yo'uve kind of proved my point on IRR by the way

&gt;EU paid for Ford to move from the UK to set up outside the EU in Turkey

Actually it was  EIB loan which is part of the long term EU integration and democratization package from the EU.  Ford made the move based IRR and project outputs. The loan helped, but it wasn't their main reason for rationalizing costs. 

BUT here's the important thing. Ford's IRR meant that Turkey was useful in order to ship the jobs there. The only way of bringing down that IRR is simple out of the EU, either we stump up the loan guarantees internally or we reduce the overall cost of the project through taxation or other incentives. 

For example - JLR they're building a plant in Saudi because the Suadi's paid for it. They're building a plant out in China because the Chinese made local loan guarantees, sorted out the workforce conditions and they're developing a huge taste for JLR products. BOTH projects are happening because the reduced IRR makes them viable. It's got NOTHING to do with Carbon Tax.  Saudi gave the a free factory. I know this because a) one of my mates was offered a job for JLR doing this and b) because I've been analyzing JLR's own CSR environmental reporting. 

&gt;Nissan said the exact same thing about joining the Euro, spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt, and HOW WRONG THEY WERE!

Well they weren't. It's the IRR. We made the IRR more competitive because we made business conditions for Nissan easier via regulations and taxation. It was also a twenty year project that wasn't going to pay bakc it's sunk costs until it was quite deep. 

By the same token, lots of companies that had deeper interest in being part of the Eurozone also left. 

But you're missing the implications of what's being argued here. 

IF we raise the IRR then companies will think twice. 

That means outside the EU, we have to do what we did before, make the investment more attractive. Outside the EU we have to do this with the added uncertainty of our tariff settlements. That means there's a higher risk premium we have to reduce. 

So how does this happen - either we offer loan guarantees and taxation cuts. Or we reduce wages and barter away levels of employment rights. that means we lose on the tax receipts on wages, or we lose on tax receipts of the company that we're attracting. Which means cuts and lower social provision. 

This is not a problem for the right- simply because less government is seen as a good thing, with a pathological belief that government getting out of the way will lead to massive wealth creation. Sure , it will initially. But not for the poor sods who end up voting UKIP - maybe for the people like Desmond backing it. 


Oh and this :

&gt;Japanese-Austalian levels of expenditure

Really? Two countries with totally different costs structures, population sizes, and social provision. You're going to sue that as an example. Economics experts lol. 

Let's deal with your other nonsense:

&gt;Talking about religious slaughter banning isn't anti-Muslim, it's pro-animal rights if anything.

Nope. It's a Danish Progress party policy, it was also adopted by Gert Wilders and Pym Fortyn who are anti-immigrant. It's also part of the Front Nationale policy in France. It's been on the hard right bulletin boards for about ten years. People like Stormfront, the Eurabia crowd lie GateofVienna.com have been pushing it as what they call ""Samizdat"" , ironically enough, or wedge issues to get the majority of the public onside. 

You have to a bit of an apologist for that lot to call it ""only "" an animal rights policy. It's not. Never has been.

&gt; your UKIP MEP for Yorkshire that was elected in the same election period, is a devout Muslim.

Yeah , I know him. Ehem.Sure.. if you say so. Again it's not  case ""oh look we have muzzies that like us too"" . It's the general drift and tone of the rhetoric. Also, the fact that UKIP seems to be firing Councillors and members only if they get caught.

&gt;The voluntary charter of understanding calling for a declaration by moderate imams, to specifically reduce tensions post 7/7 and to reaffirm British identity

Which means what? Do you mean the  MCB? The MCB proposed a voluntary statement, not a charter that Muslim should sign - or else they're disloyal. Imagine if people had asked them Jews to prove that they were loyal. It would be obvious anti-antisemitism. 

&gt;not trusting Labour to run local servies, saying there are 1,400 reasons not to trust Labour. The incumbent Labour MP himself admits he could have done more.

Right, so the best way to do that would be to use EDL / BNP election rhetoric. Obviously. Because that's what the BNP were claiming when they were using it.

London does not need a mayor; it needs a prime minister. Britain is fracturing. Scotland may yet quit the union and England turn its back on Europe. The Conservatives are throwing up barricades against the immigrants who are the capital’s lifeblood. The world’s most vibrant capital city cannot entrust its fate to a little England. This is a moment to imagine a different future: independence.


Boris Johnson, the present mayor, says he too wants power shifted from Westminster to City Hall. His demands — for a tad more financial autonomy and oversight of the courts — are piffling. Unsurprisingly so. Mr Johnson will soon vacate City Hall for the House of Commons. He aches to replace David Cameron in Downing Street. Mr Johnson’s loyalties to London count for nothing against consuming ambition.

The economics of independence speak for themselves. With a population of 8.5m (closer to 13.5m in the wider metropolitan area) London accounts for more than a fifth of Britain’s gross domestic product and generates as big a chunk of its tax revenues. This gives it an economy about the size of Sweden. Unemployment is less than 3 per cent; the demographic profile is more youthful than in the rest of the UK. Tourists spend £20bn each year in the capital.


The metropolis has become a hub for high-value global businesses reaching well beyond its traditional role as a pre-eminent centre for financial services. It is the chosen home of the footloose super-rich and those at the bottom of the pile with the energy and grit to lift themselves out of hardship. London hums with enterprise, energy and people having fun. For those who do not fret about the ethnicity of their neighbours, it is a great place to live.


Less well understood is that the capital has all the other attributes of a modern state: a natural frontier, superb transport links, first rate education and health networks, unrivalled heritage and cultural centres — even a ready-made head of state. Then there are the six first class soccer teams in the Premier League and the spiritual homes of cricket and rugby at Lord’s and Twickenham. Sure, independence would leave some rough edges. Assets and debts would have to be fairly allocated between the separating parties. London can afford to be generous.


The M25 orbital motorway is the ready-made frontier, providing access into the city and fast connections to the rest of England. The road’s on and off ramps are perfect sites for border control posts, though, in this the digital age, electronic surveillance and recognition devices would replace old-fashioned immigration queues. The identity chips now embedded in passports could readily be adapted for car windscreens.


Heathrow, of course, is scarcely a good advertisement for a 21st century city state. But, under new management, it could be turned into a half-decent airport. The rest of England would inherit Gatwick as the entry point for airlines to the south east. Passenger ferries from London to the rest of Europe would run from the Thames port of Tilbury, while Dover devolved to the rump England.


With its boroughs and town halls, London has the political infrastructure for a new democracy. Their electoral registers would determine eligibility to vote in an independence referendum. Assuming a Yes — I cannot imagine any other possibility — a new parliament would be established at Westminster.
London would eschew centralised government, adopting instead a federal constitution modelled on the one British officials wrote for the German Federal Republic. The city would thus recall a lesson Britain has forgotten: power is best exercised close to the people. Queen Elizabeth would retain her home at Buckingham Palace as the city state’s constitutional monarch. Membership of the Commonwealth would follow.


The new state would join the EU, lifting the threat to the health of its global financial institutions and other professional services. Free of the influence of the europhobes (Nigel Farage’s UK Independence party scores badly in the capital), it would join the border-free Schengen area, ensuring its doors remained open to Polish doctors, Italian designers and French mathematicians. For a time, at least, London would keep the pound. The rest of England would be free to share the currency.


Thus liberated, the capital would recognise that diversity is its strength. The children already doing most to raise standards in its schools are the offspring of first-generation immigrants. For non-EU citizens, there would be a liberal, points-based immigration regime to attract the best and brightest from around the world and match employment openings with skills.


Special arrangements would operate for workers travelling into the city from England. This should not be a problem. Britain already has an open borders model in the common travel area with Ireland. If England chose to build a fence on its side of the M25, however, its citizens would have to compete with Indian IT engineers and Brazilian entrepreneurs for work permits in London.


Doubtless, the pinched English nationalists of Ukip and anti-immigration pressure groups would cry foul. Tant pis. Their vision of statehood, fixated on the proportion of the population that is “white”, is confounded by London’s success. Saloon bar bores in the home counties can be left to their anguished debates about identity. Londoners should break free.

You'd be surprised. Elderly folk are often the most clued up because they've been getting these sorts of calls for years.

Large percentage isn't always necessarily true either. It depends on the campaign. Some are actually fairly efficient. As an example CRUK (Cancer Research UK) spent 18% of their income on fundraising for the year 2012-2013.

It was always the case that the Yes campaign would regroup and go again.  I think it's naive to assume otherwise, or that Alex Salmond elected in 2010 automatically spoke for Scots in 2020.  He simply didn't have that mandate.

I think it would be a bit rich not to respect the decision in the next parliamentary term.  The people voted on the promise they'd get devolution.  If the referendum dominated this term, then overseeing and arguing the best devolution deal should in fairness dominate the next.  After that I don't see why all deals shouldn't be off.

If I were Scottish or pro-Scottish independence I would consider that the fair independence position.  I'm neither Scottish or pro-Scottish independence (although I'm approaching more of a neutral position on it) but I don't see why I shouldn't still hold it true for those Scots that are.

I'm pro an EU referendum.  If one were ever secured and the vote didn't go my way (although I'm sure it would), then I'd respect it, and set about reforming my position in the next term.  The term after that however everything is back on the table if I want another referendum, or if something of a major gamechanger happens between then.  If the nature of the relationship drastically changes then damn right I'd want another vote.

I can only hold the same true for Scots that want their own independence.  Make sure you get your promised devolution. Reassess the new dynamic; then decide if you're going to go again.

And let me say they are damn good seats. I was so stoked to get to see a real match, live in the stadium. It was January 1st 2012, a match against Norwich. I can remember it clearly.. The excitement for me was unreal. Although it was the coldest evening i think i could have ever endured. totally unprepared american, who didnt realize people could sit in such a cold environment. Id never make that mistake again.. Been a fan every since.

Probably my fav pub in Cardiff is the Goat Major. I really like this pub, its small and run by Brains so normally has some SA or Rev. James on:

http://www.sabrain.com/goatmajor


I normally like to go eat Faggots peas and chips in the market while people watching:

http://www.cardiff-market.co.uk/


Also the Pear tree is a nice place to have a beer, its not in the Centre though, however it is close to Roath park, which is really nice and you can take a boat out on the lake:

http://www.visitcardiff.com/things-to-do/roath-park-and-lake-p9121
http://www.sabrain.com/peartree

If you go down the bay I'd suggest the water taxi trip as it nice to take in the sights. Also I'd go to the welsh cake shop, they are lovely fresh.

http://www.fabulouswelshcakes.co.uk/index.php

I also quite like Penarth, although its been a while since I have been down there. It has a nice pier:

http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/national-trust-special-places-penarth-7567603

Cardiff does have its own museum, its right in the centre but I have not been in a while:

http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/cardiff

St Fagans is good and people who come to Cardiff like it. We used to go there a lot for school so I've not been in a while:

http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/stfagans


If you go north of Cardiff you can take in Castle Coch an also Caerphilly castle. If you do I'd suggest popping in to Fagin's as thats a really nice pub (although the locals can be a bit clicky). Also really nice for a meal is the Gwaelod (this is where we normally go for special occasions as everyone likes it).

A bit further out is rest bay which is a nice beach that is normally quieter than Barry/Porthcawl:

false,Miserygut,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;The controversy is that they didn't try to replace what they sold.

There is legislation in place which prevents total reinvestment of funds procured from selling council property. These days I believe the figure is as low as 25% of the sale amount. This is on top of the significantly below-market discount that Right To Buy property is sold under.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22077190

&gt;Under the rules, councils were prevented from reinvesting most of the proceeds of council house sales in new homes. After 1990, most local authorities were only allowed to spend 25% of such receipts on building houses.

The sale of council property can be used for literally anything else like paying off debt and other year-on-year expenses. Fantastic short-termism.

Here you can read the Local Government Aassociation's response to the coalition's changes to the Right-To-Buy scheme which have only served to worsen the situation: [Link](http://www.local.gov.uk/media-releases/-/journal_content/56/10180/3924271/NEWS)

And now we can see the actual effect of these changes on council reinvestment in social housing from the RTB's own website: [Link](http://righttobuy.communities.gov.uk/faqs/)

&gt;From April 2012 to June 2014, almost 22,500 tenants had bought their home through Right to Buy.
And as part of the updated Right to Buy scheme, the money raised through extra sales is now going straight towards new affordable homes. As of June 2014, £514 million is being reinvested.

£514,000,000 / 22,500 = £22,845 from each property on average. Seems a bit low when the average property price in the UK is more than £177,000...

The reason this isn't on the political agenda is that so many people benefited from the government's firesale of assets. Disentangling the ridiculous caps on reinvestment from the Right-To-Buy legislation itself isn't even discussed which shows how hot this political potato is. Changing Right-To-Buy will be sold as ""an attack on the working classes who benefited from it"" who comprise a large percentage of the voting population still.",0,1418489639,null,0,1418493602,0,cmtt05z,t3_2p6csm,t1_cmtt05z,t1_cmtreq9,null,1425452685,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Mangala had his second best game as a citizen IMO. One really bad turnover, but on the whole he made some outstanding clearances and tackles and was very commanding.

As a result Scottish children are less likely to attain the necessary grades to attend university than English children, so don't benefit from university at all. The 25% of Edinburgh children who go to private schools do though. So a nice right-wing feudalist policy :-)

I agree with you that the SNP are to the right of Labour. Their plan for the independent Scottish state was almost Republican Tea Party in it's audacity. 

Administer a severe shock to the Scottish economy in the form of independence. (Tell all number of lies to achieve it). Once the deed is done, then shake your head about the loss of the oil revenue (mutter something about evil Americans or Saudis, take your pick), and then sorrowfully announce all manner of cuts. And Bob's your uncle, you've shrunk the state. It's exactly out of the Republican playbook when they tried to shut down the govt last year.

Re your other question - No, I'm not Scottish, the referendum is the first time I've paid attention to Scottish politics, and frankly I've been appalled. 

The amount of pig ignorant people who say ""The oil price would have risen by 2016 and would Never Ever Fall Again, because Nicola Sturgeon would have given the Saudis a stern look"". Or others who say ""Oil was just a bonus - it doesn't matter if it affects 20% of the economy and hence 20% of tax revenue, no jobs will have been lost and everything would just have continued because on independence a Tartan wand would have been waived suspending the laws of economics"". Or ""Oil is just a bonus, we'd have relied on Financial Services, because *of course* they wouldn't have decamped south in search of a central bank lender of last resort"".

And my favourite, which was an SNP man saying to me, ""It's not true that a majority were against independence, the ballot said 45% but the truth is that at 70% were in favour"".

My reaction is OMG, should we stage an intervention? Is the problem the Scottish school system not teaching people their numbers? Is it that they've fried their brains on too much whisky? What on earth has been going on up there? I think the rest of us have neglected you and left you to your own devices too long and need to start intervening and help sober you up.

Forget it, we're such a creative team there'll be ten more to have a go at. Losing games? Don't worry, well score eventually.

Exactly. To quote BUAV's website:

""Replacing animal tests does not mean putting patients at risk. It also does not mean halting medical progress. Replacing animal testing will improve both the quality and humanity of our science. Thankfully, the development of alternative methods is a growing scientific endeavour. Due to innovation in science, animal tests are being replaced in areas such as toxicity testing, neuroscience and drug development. However, much more needs to be done. The reasons why animal testing persists are often not scientific but conservatism within the scientific establishment and the bureaucratic hurdles to implementing and enforcing the use of alternative methods.""

However, I want to expand on the automation thing. Due to rising costs for food and other things that are important to livelihood, human labour get more and more expensive. Meanwhile, due to production costs falling, machines get cheaper and cheaper, and aren't too bothered about being paid enough to live on. It's a no-brainer that a machine is always going to end up being the cheaper option, even if it starts out prohibitively expensive.

Being the cheaper option makes it more attractive to bosses, therefore automation is bound to win out in the end. This displaces workers, and contributes to unemployment levels.

Right now, this isn't some economically apocalyptic event, but I foresee a point in the future (perhaps the far future, perhaps near.. not easy to guess when it'll be) when the machine to human ratio of workers is too high to continue with the current 'work for pay' system without that leading to a tragically low rate of survival for the unemployed. After all, the government only collects so much tax, and they're already (needlessly, right now) unhappy with the size of the welfare bill. With automation, that bill can only increase, because making too many cuts means people die.

I'm not saying automation is a bad thing at all. It is a symptom of technological progress, and makes everyone's lives easier in the long run. It should be encouraged, rather than held back, but the way the economy works needs to change to accommodate it, otherwise it is likely to become a terrible thing for everyone.

tl;dr: too many machines working = too few people working = too high benefits bill = unsustainable in the current economical climate. By changing the equation, it should be possible to allow for automation to increase unhindered without creating a huge crisis.

PS: I know about (and advocate) Universal Basic Income as a possible answer to this, but I deliberately left it out of my post so that I don't sound like an advert for it.

Let me explain:

The council has a claim on your home by default, whether it's theirs or yours. If you are renting from them, it's theirs, and your renting from them has a limited shelf life (twice the value of the home). Once you've paid that much in rent, the place belongs to you completely. You've bought it, and it's yours.

Someone can buy it from you, and even rent it out, but if at any point it is unoccupied for over 6 months, it automatically transfers back to council ownership to restart the process again.

The 6 months cap on vacancy allows for things like major repairs and trying to find a tenant, but rules out vacant homes sitting there for years, because nobody who's shelled out a fortune on a house really wants to lose that investment by having it revert back to council ownership without a single penny paid.

It also allows long term tenants to buy their home without sinking a massive fortune into it, because they're in the process of buying it the moment they move in.",0,1418491830,null,0,false,0,cmttxij,t3_2p6csm,t1_cmttxij,t3_2p6csm,null,1425452253,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Serious question - do you actually understand what it means that the oil price is $60 and not $120? That $60 is *half* of $120? That halving of revenue means you have to halve costs (make people redundant). That tax revenue would drop?

If you can't get your brains around it, *why* is this?

Is it denial? Is it that if you stick your fingers in your ears and go La-la-la-la-la, you think it will go away? 

Is it that you don't believe the price, and think it's a conspiracy?

Is it that you think if you were independent you would be able to force the oil price back up, and if so how?

nice infographic. its a bit like the one that's pulled out by athiests when arguing against theists. I will counter with,

[this](http://static.aboca.com/www.aboca.com/files/attach/news/risk_assessment_of_genetically_modified_crops_for_nutrition.pdf), conclusion of ""More scien-
tific effort and investigation is needed to ensure that
consumption of GM foods is not likely to provoke any
form of health problem""

or [this](http://omicsonline.org/open-access/detection-of-glyphosate-residues-in-animals-and-humans-2161-0525.1000210.pdf) which concentrates on the occurance of residue found on glyphosate GM resistant plants (plants are resistant therefore farmers use more of the herbacide which in turn leads to resistant weeds) and finds ""Presence of glyphosate in urine and its
accumulation in animal tissues is alarming even at low concentrations""

or there's [this](http://responsibletechnology.org/media/images/content/Press_Release_Gluten_11_25.pdf) which is about genetically modified foods as a possible trigger for gluten sensitivity. 

there're more but the point is, not every scientist agrees and quite a few are still calling for tests. I'm not against GMO's if they can be proven safe but all the while companies are trademarking DNA and refusing to put their research out there it's just to dangerous. 

&gt;Testing on animals is still a required step before testing on humans for safety purposes. Unless you are OK with getting humans killed, you either have animal testing or have no new pharmaceuticals.

not true. Just recently we have seen new experimental drugs being used on ebola patiants without animal testing.  And ebola, on the scale of things, isnt even that dangerous to the whole planet. It's nowhere near flu for example. All it would require is a change in law to allow seriously ill, or dying patiants to try untested drugs.

&gt;Until we can store large amounts of power effectively, it is the only way to provide a base load. No amount of solar panels and wind turbines will help you if it's a cloudy day with no wind.

I will give you the fact that our energy storage options are pretty lousy but then who's going to invest in new tech and research when the whole industry has zero backing? and true renewables are dependent on weather conditions which is why you use a combination of many different types to give you a non interrupted supply.  

&gt;Different sentences for men and women for the same crime is sexism.

then as i said, different rules for the disabled and the abled is discrimintory.  as is different rules for the rich and the poor (as in access to a lawyer), as is different rules for people with children and people without.  you either have true equality in everything or you look at things pragmatically.  if prison is shown to be detrimental to the rehabilitation of woman why not change that? why not look at the evidence, after all isnt that what people say the green party doesnt do? 

&gt;Vandalism of GM research is a good thing??

being able to protest is a good thing. a politician being willing to go to jail for that right is worth looking upto.

&gt;Different doesn't equal good. 

That hasnt stopped UKIP getting support. I joke, but seriously different does equal good. it makes the established parties take note and maybe they change their stances to include all of society and not just those who they think will get them elected and if they fail to change then they get voted out and democracy worked.  how is that not a good outcome?

&gt;the Monster Raving Loony party usually has better policy proposals than the greens.

that is such an utterly biased view that I won't even bother. 

&gt;Like how the greens blame their poor election results on the media?

what you mean the medai who never gives them coverage. yeah the media has no part to play at all. thats why UKIP gets a story in nearly every single day and they've gone from relatively unknown to a household name. yeah media has no part to play at all does it.

At a desperate time of no work I took a job with a small charity in Wales doing just this type of thing. We had two campaigns, one was a collection card we sent out to you which required no other details from you other than your agreement and address (which we already had). There was a minimal bonus available for the top sender here (something like a £5 Tesco voucher every week). If you did this for us then your number would be put forward for a call for the lottery in the future.

The other campaign was a weekly lottery draw, this required you to supply your bank details for a direct debit to be set up for a regular entry. The charity also had the ability to enter the draw via their website.

Now the reason the caller was so pushy for your details to sign you up there and then is that they will be required to get a certain number of people to sign up to the lottery in order to keep their job, also there will be bonuses on their wage if they exceed targets on lottery signups.  People who did well on this campaign were able to rake in a fair amount over their wages. However if they directed you to the website and you signed up they would not get recognition for the sale.

It wasn't a nice job, managed to stick it for 2 years before giving it up - never again would I do any form of telesales, rather take my chances on the street if it came to it.

Farage seems to be nothing more than ""more of exactly the same"" another farm-manager wearing a different colour jacket, cap, tie, and badge (albeit with a slight twist they want to undo Maastricht, and distance the UK politically, economically and administratively from Europe) ...

Unless anyone can demonstrate he's *not* of course. ;)

Please don't deprive yourself of that which you are entitled by depriving others that same right (if you are entitled to vote you *are* entitled to answers, justice and above all honesty, from the (at the moment highly corrupt) political class, that is at present lining their own pockets when they should be working for the electorate.

Don't be fobbed off, *ask* them the difficult questions, *demand* an investigation into graft, nepotism, cronyism, kickbacks, and profiteering, and  *insist* on trials, and *appropriate* punishments for all those found guilty (regardless of rank or reputation).

*Or* you could just burn Magna-Carta (1215), The Bill of Rights (1689), Crown and Parliament Act (1689), etc and do away with the protections and rights they entitle you to, and just do as you are told by a corrupt elite in a lawless dystopia. 

Who knows where *that* could lead???

Rand? Huxley? Orwell? 

TBH I think Orwell summed it up quite nicely with...

""If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever.""


However I would alter it (to fit context better) to say...

""If you want a vision of the future, (if corruption throughout the administration of the nation is *not* rooted out,) imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever.""


Just saying, y'know ;)

&gt;next best thing is build the best first team you can and actually use the older Academy players as needed to supplement

Agreed. I love seeing the youth come up from the academy. But you're missing a huge point about football in general: if you're not good enough, you don't play. We buy young players (i.e. Markovic, Moreno, etc.) because they're proven to be consistently quality in top football leagues.

Mate, Sterling got that chance because he was good, and he's continued to be excellent and so he's in our starting XI. Simple as that. Teixeira was solid in the what, the one game where he subbed on? Ilori's never played for us, Ibe is looking good but is still young (as is Wisdom) and unproven. 

Bottom line is we're looking to win the season (long-term) and that doesn't happen with a starting XI of brilliant players and a bench of academy hopefuls.

Taxes that contribute to our welfare state.

So, while we've achieved nothing to solve the problem, we've increased the cost of living, received fewer taxes and fewer jobs. But hey, at least our tree-hugging conscience is clear. Should be the motto for the Green party.

&gt;&gt;Non-white doesn't mean non-British

&gt;It does in my parlance, but I appreciate that a gigantic semantic shift has taken place over the decades by a concerted propaganda effort to negate indigenous British people's essential identity.

&gt;Perhaps, if I used the word English instead of British, you would know where I'm coming from because that word has yet to be destroyed by Cultural Marxist revisionism, though I'm sure they're working on it.

&gt;If you control the language, you control the thought. If you control the thought, you can control people's actions. First deny that Britain has its own distinct genetic identity (it does), but after everyone is convinced it doesn't, they will willingly accept their own oblivion, because it has already been negated and justified for them. They don't feel like they're losing anything, because they've been lied to and told they never had anything to begin with. It's a tragedy.

They're racist as fuck.

&gt;As you say it was a risk, but you need to take risks in life to gain rewards

That's what the Irish said when they entered the euro. Not only are they having to pay 50 euros each time they see a GP, but they are now facing the tax euphemistically known as ""water charges"" (Google it).

In terms of gambles, only the American one came off, and in their first 50 years it really was touch and go. What stabalised them was growing - from the moment of the Louisiana purchase and the push west, they started to strengthen as they gained both land and people. Bigger units are much more stable than small ones - which of course is why Scotland joined the union in the first place.

I believe that before the century is out the Irish will have rejoined the British Isles too - they've started to openly talk about it, it will especially be on the cards if the euro fails and they need the safety of the sterling zone (i.e. not just using sterling, but being within the UK so that they have the benefit of a solidarity tax subsidy).

false,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"I agree that automation will eventually be invested in, but a company will not willingly bankrupt itself. For example, we're wearing cloths that were made with sowing machines cheaper than we have collecting dust in our attics. Why? Because companies can throw huge numbers of workers at the problem for practically nothing. Even if a decent sowing machine made the workers 2% faster, the initial outlay probably isn't worth it.

I mean a person can make 200 pairs of shoes and not even be able to afford a single pair. If a company in a competitive market invested in automation it would have to offer extremely significant returns.
If you increase the cost of labour, though, that shoe robot or 3D printer starts looking like a better and better deal.

I support basic income, in principle, because it would make working peoples lives better. However, it isn't a magic bullet because there will still be a mode of exploitation. The best thing that could happen in our life time is the reemergence of a strong trade unionist movement that has learnt the lessons of the past. We need workplace democracies that prohibit exploitation and wage cuts - even if growth is the sole concern (which it shouldn't be) we need wages to constantly increase for the system to sustain itself. Inflation is the fear, but that just means assets are becoming less valuable - we only need to worry if governments are buying up their own debt, inflation as a product of having a more equal society will not lead to all businesses going bust.

 We need to have a mechanism to fight for better pay or the wealthy will be left to destroy civilisation with their greed. To put it very bluntly, their interests will never be ours and we just can't trust them to rule in our interest. Only through the use of devices like nationalism and constant propaganda are they able to convince us that their interests are our interests, and they might sincerely believe it or they might be scumbag liers. It just isn't true.

This paper cites Giles-Eric Seralini.

&gt;or this which concentrates on the occurance of residue found on glyphosate GM resistant plants (plants are resistant therefore farmers use more of the herbacide which in turn leads to resistant weeds) and finds ""Presence of glyphosate in urine and its accumulation in animal tissues is alarming even at low concentrations""

This paper has an error in the conclusions:
&gt;Unknown impacts of glyphosate on human and animal health warrants further investigations 

We actually know what the impact of glyphosate is. It's about as toxic as table salt. It does not bio-accumulate. There is no evidence that it can cause any long-term harm.

&gt;or there's this which is about genetically modified foods as a possible trigger for gluten sensitivity.

This is so blatantly biased that I don't think I need to give further explanation.

&gt; I'm not against GMO's if they can be proven safe

You cannot prove anything safe. Proof only exists in the field of mathematics.

&gt;but all the while companies are trademarking DNA and refusing to put their research out there it's just to dangerous.

Companies cannot trademark DNA, and they do put their research out there; you just cannot be bothered to look.

&gt;not true. Just recently we have seen new experimental drugs being used on ebola patiants without animal testing. 

Sure, we can test on people without doing animal testing. We don't normally do this though, because it can kill people.

Like I said, are you OK with killing people just to get rid of animal testing?

&gt;I will give you the fact that our energy storage options are pretty lousy but then who's going to invest in new tech and research when the whole industry has zero backing?

Loads of people are investing and researching in this field, but until it yields results, attempting to switch entirely to wind and solar would be economic suicide.

Incidentally, there is another solution that the Green Party doesn't like funding. They are anti-ITER (ITER is the EU's fusion power plant project).

&gt;being able to protest is a good thing. a politician being willing to go to jail for that right is worth looking upto.

Vandalism isn't protest, it's vandalism.

I'm not seeing it in your comments to me, nor in your comments to others either.

&gt; You're welcome to cruise through my comments and find out for yourself. I did a politics degree and happen to work at three unis as an associate teaching management. 

Wasn't it history a minute ago?   Whatever.

You don't actually know what the party stands for.  You certainly have shown piss poor reading comprehension.  I'm not intimidated by your intellectual wang.  How does teaching management even remotely mean you're informed on your daily politics?  It doesn't.  

Did you just read 'misinformed' as meaning uneducated in general?  It sounds like you did.   
You've certainly not given me anything to suggest you are more informed when it comes to your politics and current affairs than, well, most people here actually.

I've just read somebody trying to explain to you how being against mass immigration doesn't mean that you're anti-immigration.  That you can be pro-immigration and still be against open door immigration.  A pretty simple concept, but you don't seem to be grasping it.

&gt;You obviously don't understand the arguments about economics, when you talk about SMEs after quoting a our GDP figure, or you've not udnerstood your own source.

I'm quoting the source!  It appears you didn't even open it.

&gt;Even if SME's save transaction costs or opportunity costs due to deregulation. The offset is the cost of trade in tariffs AND the risk premium on the projects.

We'd have a free trade deal under article 50.  Federalists in the EU have advocated giving the UK an AA deal for free trade if we left.  We already have a trade deal with the EU outside our EU membership in signing EFTA separately.   We have protections afforded by the WTO.  Digby Jones formerly CBI director general talks about negotiating free trade with the EU in 24hrs if needed.

There would be no trade tariffs.     
Again, this really calls into questioning your economic claims.  You don't seem that aware at all.

The rest is misdirection and more flannel, because apparently you've still not opened the file.  It's transparent at this stage.

&gt;BUT here's the important thing. Ford's IRR meant that Turkey was useful in order to ship the jobs there. 

LOL - so we should be grateful that we closed a factory in the UK and moved the jobs to Turkey?!

Gee, thanks!

&gt;Well they weren't. &lt;&lt;&lt;Nissan wrong in saying the UK must join the Euro&gt;&gt;&gt;

BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Yeah, Nissan really nailed that one.  They were so right that we should have joined the Euro....   

Yes. Big ""/s""

&gt;Really? Two countries with totally different costs structures, population sizes, and social provision. You're going to sue that as an example. Economics experts lol.

The US is lower still than Australia and Japan.  Both bigger and smaller populations of developed countries spend less.  All this doomsaying about 1930s spending is deliberately trying to portray something as negatively as possible - when the elephant in the room is that everybody agrees between the parties deficit has to come down.

&gt;Nope. It's a Danish Progress party policy,

We're not in Denmark.

It's perfectly reasonable to question religious slaughter of animals around animal welfare.  They looked into it and argued that it was okay based on animal welfare.

Again, this is your poor lack of understanding and knowledge.

&gt;Yeah , I know him. Ehem.Sure.. if you say so. Again it's not case ""oh look we have muzzies that like us too"" . It's the general drift and tone of the rhetoric. Also, the fact that UKIP seems to be firing Councillors and members only if they get caught.

If I say so?  His name is Amjad Bashir and he is an MEP for Yorkshire.  He is your MEP.  It's not bezzie mates - it's an elected representative.  He was second top candidate voted by the NEC and local groups.  The electorate at large then elected him into office.

&gt;The MCB proposed a voluntary statement, not a charter that Muslim should sign - or else they're disloyal.

They proposed (it wasn't policy) *after consulting Muslim communities*, that there should be a voluntary charter to reaffirm British values at a time when there were tensions post 7/7.   'Loyal' is your word.  It was voluntary and only asked community leaders.  It was a proposal.  The MCB adopted something very similar of their own volition.

&gt;Right, so the best way to do that would be to use EDL / BNP election rhetoric. 

They said there were 1400 reasons to not vote Labour, because there was a historic case of where 1400 children had been abused on Labour's watch, and the incumbent Labour MP at the time said he knew about it.  That Labour failed the most vulnerable in society.

It is not BNP or EDL rhetoric to complain about systemic failure at the hands of the Labour party.  Nobody has a monopoly on criticising political parties for their party in large scale paedophile scandals.

The poster says 'Labour'.  You've seen it and apparently read 'Muslim'.

It says don't trust Labour as a Police and Crimes Commissioner because they'd failed.   The previous Labour crime commissioner had to resign.

The 4231 doesn't work when one of the 2 doesn't defend. Personally I hope Pellegrini plays them again in the last 16 because it was the most solid we've looked in a European game for ages. 

Pogba is a true box to box midfielder. He has the engine to do what yaya does in attack, and the defensive work Yaya won't. 

Added benefits obviously being he is 21, while Yaya and Fernandinho are going to be 32 and 30 respectively. At 32 Yaya is only going downhill, even if he avoids another period like we saw at the beginning of the season. Not to mention he's going to Africa for all of January.

I think the fundamental problem with the Greens is that they want a *big* welfare state on the back of a *weak* economy, which doesn't tend to be sustainable in the long term. As the economy slows or gets weaker, the less money/taxes there will be for welfare, the NHS etc, and the more they'll have to make spending cuts or raise taxes to compensate, creating a bit of a downward spiral.

&gt;The natural and rational first question with a nation confronted by such a prospect is to ask: ""How can its dimensions be reduced?"" Granted it be not wholly preventable, can it be limited, bearing in mind that numbers are of the essence: the significance and consequences of an alien element introduced into a country or population are profoundly different according to whether that element is 1 per cent or 10 per cent. 

Pressure on services:

&gt;But while, to the immigrant, entry to this country was admission to privileges and opportunities eagerly sought, the impact upon the existing population was very different. For reasons which they could not comprehend, and in pursuance of a decision by default, on which they were never consulted, they found themselves made strangers in their own country. 

&gt;They found their wives unable to obtain hospital beds in childbirth, their children unable to obtain school places, their homes and neighbourhoods changed beyond recognition

Thought police:

&gt;but what surprised and alarmed me was the high proportion of ordinary, decent, sensible people, writing a rational and often well-educated letter, who believed that they had to omit their address because it was dangerous to have committed themselves to paper to a Member of Parliament agreeing with the views I had expressed, and that they would risk penalties or reprisals if they were known to have done so. 

Lack of integration of immigrant communties due to the scale of migration:

&gt;There are among the Commonwealth immigrants who have come to live here in the last fifteen years or so, many thousands whose wish and purpose is to be integrated and whose every thought and endeavour is bent in that direction.

&gt;We are on the verge here of a change. Hitherto it has been force of circumstance and of background which has rendered the very idea of integration inaccessible to the greater part of the immigrant population - that they never conceived or intended such a thing, and that their numbers and physical concentration meant the pressures towards integration which normally bear upon any small minority did not operate.

* Hazard was brilliant, he made some wonderful (fancy) passes and runs, he practically won us this game. It was a shame that his brilliant run near the end didn't end in a goal because for some reason Costa didn't give it back to him. (does anyone have a video of his touches for this game?)

* Was it just me or was the home support about 2x louder this game than any other time we play a weak team? Very impressed, constant cheers throughout the entire game despite the shit performance

* Fabregas was missed greatly

* Overall frustrating game but I'm happy. Finals are finally fucking over and its rounded out with another blue win. On to Derby!

Even with profit margins included in many areas it is possible to offer cheaper and better services than the NHS can. It's the same arguement for private companies, sometimes it's cheaper and offers better results not to have a function in house. If you arguement was true, then every company in the world would have every function in-house and if you know anything about business organisations you would see that that they don't. 

As an example, the child neuro psychology rehabilitation in the NHS at the moment is appalling, most kids go without. If a company working in the private sector is able to offer a good value for money home based service that NHS is unable to provide its in everyone's interest to let them do so. If the NHS can provide this service cheaper and of higher quality, then its also in our interest to let them do so. I use this as an example as it's one I know through family and the costs for treatment they charge would undercut any centrally run system, due to remote working and the simplicity of the structuring of the company (1 manager, 1 admin staff and 30 expert psychologists working around the country).   

Another example, my mum went to the doctors to get a DNA test so see if a preventative operation was necessary, 23andme, a private company currently offer the test for online for £125, yet the bureaucracy involved by going through the NHS was undoubtedly more expensive than just buying the test itself, let alone the test cost of the test they provide.

Cameron has a way of saying exactly what he should say to avoid any disagreement or unwise commitment so it's always hard to listen to him without basically agreeing with the underlying sentiments he talks about even if you think he's a cock.

I struggle to remember any such passage.

&gt;he suggested that the only discrimination resulting from immigration was against British citizens, and suggested that the Race Relations Act (that, among other things, stopped businesses discriminating based upon skin colour) would allow immigrants to dominate Britain. 

His argument, rightly or wrongly, was that it would do more harm than good. It would harm in the sense of equality and fairness, if we elevate one peoples in law so that they may have different rights and privileges to others then equality can never take place, this is why he and many of the people of this nation ,78% of which agreed with Powell, felt that this bill would lead to the indigenous population being discriminated against and put in the dock and be treated differently in law to those who were, and continue to be, coming.

We have improved relationships with our allies, allowing for improved trade relations and greater wealth creation domestically as a result.

Obviously, lots of the money spent on the military and the domestic contractors goes back into the economy and allows for improved competitiveness of related industries internationally.

The military is also extremely helpful in natural disasters and other large and unplanned events.

The obvious benefit is greater security.

Of course we can look back now and say; ""Oh, that was a waste of money, why did we bother with that?"". And we'd be right about a lot of government policies, including defence spending. Defence spending is an insurance policy above all else, because if everything else goes wrong in the country, the backbone of the military prevents those final blows.

I think it's important to think of the modern military as more than just a knife with which we can exert force, but rather a toolset that can be used for leverage, repair, maintenance and defence.

He is a top notch bloke, has the full support of his players - the way they play shows that.  We are where we are now because of him, and he deserves everyone to get behind him.

Mahrez had them in dire straits at times, good performance. His feet are awesome, and he wins his fair share of tackles and headers - if not in the defensive third.

Schlupp needed to get more involved.  

Drinkwater and Cambiasso worked tirelessly and deserve a shout together next time.

Wrong. It was a UKIP councillor: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-25793358

Before accusing others of bullshitting try spending thirty seconds using google. Otherwise you just end up making yourself look foolish. Well, more foolish.

Ok, ignoring the name calling I will cheerfully concede that you can't just judge a political party by the odd bad apple. However the UKIP bad to good apple ratio is just a bit unfortunate. Significant even. And the ones who haven't put their foot in it yet seem to change their tune depending in the audience they are talking to and keep dropping dog-whistle phrases that might fly under most radars but don't fool everyone. 

So, that that 'dialogue about immigration': have you ever considered is *that* not a distraction from the real political  problems? Given who the primary big donors to UKIP are can't you see that? Blaming the outsider is a tactic older than history. At any rate UKIP certainly sure as hell aren't the people to have this ""dialogue"": it's ever so slightly obvious they have already made up their minds. 

UKIP may not all be racists and bigots but enough of the rank and file and fellow travellers are that I have nothing but unqualified contempt for the 'useful idiots' who hold their noses and go along with them.

A quick cure to a flooded engine is to open the throttle fully and use the starter. Then just let it rest for a several seconds before giving it another go.

Another thing to consider is what engine oil are you using? If it's 10W40 (which is most likely but I thought it safe to ask anyway) it should be fine, but obviously as it's getting quite cold now anything like a 15W30 might have trouble starting, as the oil is too viscous for the engine to crank properly.

You seem to think the opposite and i'm not sure I understand why. Managers build teams to succeed with the assets they have, so when those assets are gone, even if the team continues playing the system it has been playing it will lack something that originally made it work (in Liverpool's case the final third).

Some managers, like rafa, have many systems and thats fine. Brendan has a singular vision of how to play and if Sturridge comes back and starts scoring it would validate that vision and show us that we are simply missing equal caliber/skilled depth in his position.

Brendan's idea of a plan B is to swap an essentially like for like player within a singular system. Now we can see that the mess this summer means Brendan does not have any player to replace Sturridge with.

Its unfair to want Brendan to completely change his system because he keeps expecting Sturridge to be back in a couple weeks. I would imagine changing a system requires valuable time to learn and to actually become usable. Then Sturridge comes back and the whole team isn't on the same page.

In fighting ISIS we're allying ourselves to their regional opponents, and helping them to win. None of them are very nice. 

The most sympathetic of our new allies are the Kurds. One Kurdish group has been fighting a campaign of terror in Turkey (not without provocation) and if the Kurds win they will probably have a civil war.

Then there's Iran, who are using this as a way of gaining regional influence. Iran will possibly become a modern democratic state a few decades after the West stop demonising and attacking them, but at the moment they are a theocracy with a dreadful human rights record. 

And there's Iran's proxy Shia militia groups, with their well known love of power tools. 

Then there's KSA which has been sort-of-funding this sort of thing for some time, and whose leaders have belatedly realised will all come back to bite them. Another theocracy with a dreadful human rights record. 

And finally there's Assad who admittedly we're not directly allied with, and who we tried to fight a while ago, but now we find ourselves on the same side as.

false,MrFuckingRandom,null,null,"Firstly, to discipline you, they would have to show some sort of misconduct, and although that is based on the balance of probabilities, it is very questionable 'evidence' and in my opinion, it would be unreasonable to pull you up for anything. In my opinion, they won't do anything. 

A more pressing issue in my opinion, and also the basis for my belief that they wont do anything, is this delay. Your post implies they haven't even spoken to you yet and its been ~20 days. The ACAS code of practice (1) which is the go-to when discipline is considered, and I'll break down the important points for you:

4. Employers and employees should raise and deal with issues **promptly**. In some cases, this will require the holding of an investigatory meeting with the employee before proceeding to any disciplinary hearing.

9. If it is decided there is a disciplinary case to answer, the employee should be notified of this in writing.  

11. The meeting should be held without unreasonable delay whilst allowing the employee time to prepare their case.

13. Workers have a statutory right to be accompanies by a companion where the disciplinary meeting could result in: a formal warning; taking of some other disciplinary action.

25. where an employee feels that disciplinary action is wrong or unjust, they should appeal against the decision. 

So, taking that into account and assuming they were going to do anything, they'd be acting unreasonably in not conducting a prompt investigation and the investigation itself would be flawed by not interviewing you. 

You won't be sacked for this. It's not gross misconduct  and case-law (Ladbrokes v Arnott) says that any rules that *are* in place have to be applied reasonably and sensibly. As I said, I don't think anything will come of this, but it is important to note that your employer isn't a court and they aren't restricted by the same laws of evidence. They only have to act reasonably. But with that in mind, on these facts, they can't *reasonably* do anything.

This would mean that, even if someone did walk down the street, was a racist, thought all black people would attack him if he even glanced at him, and then he accidentally did so... If he then attacked them, potentially murdering them, I don't think they'd have the defense of self-defense, since it's not a *reasonably*-held belief.

**Edit**: Oh, also, according to [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defence_in_English_law#Reasonable_force), they would be required to use reasonable force. I think it would be difficult for the accused to convince a jury that he felt it was reasonable to attack (or even kill) someone as he believed that simply looking at them would provoke them to attack him, since if he honestly held the belief that it would happen, he should have attempted to avoid the scenario. This may be incorrect, though, since apparently the accused does not have a [duty to retreat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_retreat)...

You need to earn over around £200,000 per year before your income tax approaches 40% of your income (at £200,000, it's 38%).  But if you're earning £200,000 a year you're only paying around 4% of your income towards national insurance.  So I'm not sure where your figures come from, but I don't think they reflect what you pay.

And the VAT rate is 20%, but that doesn't mean 20% of your income!  But it doesn't make much sense to consider the VAT you pay as a proportion of your earnings anyway, as they're unrelated.  But you certainly won't be paying VAT amounting to 20% of your income, as that would only be possible if you spent every penny of your pre-income-tax income on VAT-applicable goods, which is impossible for multiple reasons!

[Just in case I'm right, I'll explain tax bands, as lots of people get a bit confused about them.  I like to explain them as empty jugs of increasing size, sitting in a row.  You have a big bottle of water which represents your salary.  Starting at the left hand side, you pour your water into the jugs, filling each to the brim before moving onto the next.  Then the government comes along and lets you keep all of the first jug, 80% of the second jug, 60% of the third jug and 55% of anything left in your bottle.  So your effective tax rate and your tax band aren't the same.

BBC was originally the only broadcaster, so the licence fee was a good idea. Then another channel came along, but nobody could hand-on-heart say they never watched BBC, so the licence fee remained.

As more and more channels popped up, it began to look a little odd that you had to pay the BBC to watch *any* of the other channels. But, like boiling frogs, the change was gradual and there was never a moment when we said enough is enough.

But the next generation of viewers are not going to own conventional TVs, they will just stream programs from iPlayer style websites. And, aside from iPlayer itself, there is simply no question of them paying the BBC for the privilege. Imagine if you had to pay the BBC a fee before you were allowed to join netflix? Nobody would wear it.
