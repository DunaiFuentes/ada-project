Excluding 50M in wages is a bit lazy- this came from another article which basically said ""50% of the wage bill = 50M, so 50M"".   Which entirely disregards the fact that the 100M+ wage bill is nowhere near all for the first team (roughly 60% of it is) which means they would be writing off nearly all the first team wages.

In their projection, they're entirely ignoring the 10M+ we added to our amortization amount in the summer.

The new TV money (they're counting it as 20M, which is fair enough) doesn't get paid until the season over and it's not 100% clear it would make it into the 13/14 FY.

Now comes Sherwood, with two catastrophic defeats, a couple of mediocre performances against bottom teams, and after his public derision of the team, everything is all flowers and sunshine as far as the coaching department is concerned.

We are constantly playing the ball out wide and cutting in or pressing with the wings and THEN passing through the middle.

Indeed, had they been left in their home countries, perhaps something even worse could have happened. Some may argue that we are standing on the shoulders of inherited wealth. But this ignores the fates of countries which have rapidly industrialised and become rich from even less historical wealth.

It has been a long time, and should they wish they could move en masse to wherever they please. Although I make no assertions regarding the ease, welcome or treatment once they arrive, even if this is their 'origin nation' - should such a manifestation exist.

However saying that, their requests are not exactly difficult to progress. In the interests of friendly relations and just damned neighbourly behaviour, it would be somewhat agreeable for us to progress their agendas. However by attaching their pleas to slavery they have diplomatically put themselves in a bit of stumbling block. In order for us to help them with these requests, it will appear as if we are accepting responsibility somewhat, which opens us up larger claims.

Aleksandar Tonev has been told he must improve – but Paul Lambert is still convinced the winger has all the attributes to be a success at Aston Villa.

Tonev has been left out of some of the claret and blues’ matchday squads lately and Lambert admits he is “looking for more” from the Bulgarian international.

The 24-year-old has failed to score or provide an assist for Villa in eight starts and ten substitute appearances since signing from Lech Poznan last June.

Tonev did not make the 18 for the 4-1 victory over Norwich the weekend before last and his last start came in the 1-1 home draw against Swansea in late December.

Since then Lambert has preferred to include rejuvenated wideman Marc Albrighton in Villa’s first XI or in the squad ahead of Tonev, who cost a reported £2.5 million.

Tonev, who also attracted interest from Celtic last summer, has flattered to deceive in claret and blue, with wild shots characterising his mediocre performances.

But Lambert believes he boasts plenty of ability and can still shine on the Premier League stage once he adjusts to the demands of the English top flight.

“You’re looking for more from Alex,” said Lambert.

“He’s got all the attributes there as well; speed, two feet, everything’s there for him.

“He’s probably taken longer to adjust with a lot of things.",0,1394510549,null,0,false,0,cfzlgfi,t3_2041it,t1_cfzlgfi,t3_2041it,null,1432748266,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

Aston Villa will attempt to make Ryan Bertrand’s loan move from Chelsea a permanent deal in the summer.

The 24-year-old defender is understood to be open to the idea of leaving Stamford Bridge to play regular first-team football for the Villans under boss Paul Lambert.

Bertrand, who has two years left on his contract with the Londoners , will sit out Saturday’s clash against his parent club at Villa Park but could join the claret and blues if the two clubs can agree a fee at the end of the season.

Bertrand said: “Paul Lambert was one of the main catalysts of me coming to this club, because he’s a manager whose teams play the way that I like to play.

“He really encourages you to express yourself on the pitch so it’s always a pleasure to play this way.

“To play with the boys has been fantastic, on and off the pitch. In training there’s a fantastic mentality from all the boys and it’s a fantastic area to learn in.”

Bertrand also believes Villa, currently in 11th position, can clinch a top 10 place this season after putting a six-point gap between themselves and the relegation zone.

“We can definitely push for the 10th spot and that’d be a really good finish,” he added.

“We don’t want to set a limit on it, we just want to win as many as we can. I think the players have shown people where the bar can be set, especially with the win over Norwich.

“It’s important to try and get the consistency. Not to necessarily match those levels equally, but to be not too far off that on a consistent basis. If we do that we’ll be able to achieve some great things.”

Mata and De Bruyne are attacking midfielders/wingers whose primary role is to assist and score goals. The reason they left is a combination of several things, including super depth in their position, financial considerations, playing time, attitude, etc. 

The other guys I mentioned have played a significant part of their time in a 2 or 3 man midfield similar to our 4-**2**-3-1 or 4-**3**-3. Their job is not primarily to attack, but to provide the link *between* defense and attack. Mourinho has had players like this, recently all those I mentioned at Madrid (save Illarra). Furthermore, he's acknowledged that linking the defense with the attack has been a problem. He specifically mentioned this as his reason for subbing off Lampard for Oscar in the Spurs game. A lot of us (including me) think Oscar could play deeper in midfield more frequently, but then we are left with no one who can play as an attacking midfielder/ number 10 quite as well as him.

I'm American, from New York. My Dad had a job in London for about 10 years, so my family lived there on a permanent resident basis, though we were all still American citizens. While over there my sister and I were both born, and we lived in Chelsea for the first 4 years of my life. As soon as my Dad noticed that my sister and I were starting to develop English accents he decided it was time to leave, and we moved back to New York where we've lived ever since.

I was too young to remember much about living in London but my parents told me we had lived in Chelsea and told me about the club, so I always knew I was a Chelsea fan but not necessarily what that meant. 

My earliest memory of the club was at around 7 or 8, when my parents told me we had gone to a fair few matches back when we lived there. I excitedly asked them if Chelsea had ever played United since they were the only soccer team I had heard of at that point. I cringe every time I think about that now. 

Besides that, I remember seeing us play Milan in the Meadowlands when I was 12 or 13 which would've been around '05, and we won handily, I think I remember it being 4-1. Which sparked my interest in Chelsea as Milan were another huge club at that point and I wasn't aware of the mastery Mourinho was bringing to us at the time.

Since then I've followed Chelsea to increasing degrees, and in the last 4 or 5 years have become a really dedicated fan. Following Chelsea sort of feels like a link to my English-ish past, so it's actually become a relatively big part of my identity. 

And last February I got to go to the Bridge and see us beat Arsenal 2-1, which was a dream come true as I had never been before and hate Arsenal more than any other team.

The thing that irks me most is that he has been utterly unreliable to make appearances this year. He has played only a handful of games for us. The fact that he wants to be a starter means that we cannot buy super competitive backups, so when he inevitably gets injured (admittingly it has only been an issue this year) we play poorer players (Zeki or Naughton) or deputize our better players in their less favorable positions (Jan) which hurts performance and morale. If Rose played week-in-week-out like Walker, I wouldn't have an issue at all. Our biggest problems come when he gets injured, which he seems to be all the time nowadays. He essentially holds the club hostage in this regard by saying I need to be sole starter and then getting injured and putting us in a shit situation. My patience is basically through with him. Keep Zeki and get someone like Davies who stays healthy (He has played 34 matches this season, compared to Rose's 20), is homegrown, and is more talented and younger.

Been around since the early [1980s.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/probe/doc/TechPCR.shtml) Without the ability to replicate many many copies of any stretch of DNA the human genome project would have been pretty much impossible.

All groups/subgroups need to work on the same sequence and even if there were a big enough person to err, how do I put this, grind up and share out- human DNA is only a part of the total DNA in our bodies (we're home to entire ecosystems of micro-organisms - most of which we need in order to remain healthy).

&gt; small enough and cheap enough that any criminal (or shadowy government agency) can take any part of your DNA and replicate it and leave it somewhere to either incriminate you or blackmail you.

Saying we want Paulinho, Lamela, Chadli, Rose etc out of the door already, - if we don't show loyalty to our players why should the ones we are desperate to keep, or the really good ones, show any loyalty to us. 
 
It is a job, he has no reason to show us loyalty.
 
We play him out of position, when he said he doesn't want to play there. 
 
We have a manager that is totally clueless, and shouldn't even be a manager, why would any player want to stick around and deal with that.
 
Wouldn't be surprised if everyone wanted to leave after the joke that has been this season, Blaming a player that is thinking about his career first is the easy way, yes lets blame bale for wanting to leave, and berbatov, and keane, and modric, how about hoddle when we sold him to monaco, or gazza when we sold him to lazio, or waddle when he left for Marseille. We don't deserve to hold on to our better players because the people to blame for us not fulfilling our potential is Levy and ENIC. 
 
He came here to improve himself, and play for bigger and better things, so far he has had none of that at Spurs. 
 
He took a risk by coming here, and was probably promised that we would qualify for the champions league and we won't do that in the two seasons he has been here. That isn't his fault, sure he has made mistakes all players do. But what sort of signal does it send to players like Jan when he joins and King retires, VDV is sold, Modric is sold, and then the following season Bale is sold. 
 
As i keep saying we reap what we sow, - we sell out best players, our next best players don't see improvement in the squad they will also want to move on and leave.

true,theYword,null,null,"I like to think of it as our 23rd transition season in a row. There have been a number of times when Levy has looked to create an overarching set up and philosophy to the way things are done but his grand visions have rarely come to fruition. He brought in Arnesen, Santini and Jol all at once and completely restructured the club and it lasted about 6 weeks. Last season he brings in AVB and then Baldini and gives them £100m to spend but gets cold feet and fires AVB (and looks like Baldini will also leave) after just a few poor results. AVB is a very paticular manager with very paticular methods and needs a good couple of seasons to properly institute his way of playing (not 100% sure I like his style, but he has one). 

I agree therefore that it is mismanagement but would argue that its not just this season. ENIC have never been sure as to whether they want to buy instant success or actually build something at the club and the result is a complete half way nowhere situation. Look at the new stadium. Its been 3 years from completion for about 10 years. 

Having said all that, I am not too depressed. For all the millions spent, we are marginally better than we used to be 10 years ago (when sherwood was haplessly barking from the centre of the pitch rather than the side of it). I don't see this season as a shambles because I never expected that much of it in the first place, despite people suggesting we were title challengers in August. Next season I bravely predict that we will finish 6th after LVG leaves in December during a press conference because someone questioned his wisdom.

true,lawschoolzombie,null,null,"Valid contention to which I have one exception. I think principally, we have had two major problems in our attack - one transition - two finishing.  The latter is a well documented problem. Let's talk former:

I think this is something we saw in the Spurs game, in the Fulham first half and in the Gala second half. We lose ball in counter attack transitions, we are not able to make over the top / through balls from the around center circle to our wingers / strikers. This is why our strikers are drawn in (and don't make the beat the offside trap runs - as is common in many counter attacking sides - ex - Dortmund / last year RM), I will concede that part of this problem is also lack of pace / vision by our strikers (Ba and Etoo have no pace and Torres *sometimes* lacks the vision to make these runs). Schurrle tries this when he is given a forward role (remember Man United early in the season?) but sucks at timing them (ok may be not, but damn is it frustrating watching him suck at it). 

Another problem this poses is teams that sit deep. Obviously we are not tiki taca extraordinaire, so when teams basically bunch together and ask us to fuck our selves with our counter attacks, one of the alternatives deployed by possession teams like United (of SAF era - 2007-09), Barca, Bayern etc. is the ability to chip balls / place balls in to the box for one touch shots. We could do this with Mata... but we need to find someone who can do this again (Oscar, Willian, Hazard et. al. - no offence).

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"52% to me says ""known not to work in any shape or form"". A test that 100% always gives you the wrong result from a choice of two is a test that 100% always gives you the correct result just by flipping it over. 52% is, as near as makes no difference, meaningless - a coin-toss. If the result from the test is unrelated to what it's meant to test (or if you need bad science to claim otherwise) that test simply doesn't work.

And for anything that measures stress, it should be obvious that it's a bad indicator of lying.

There are many ways to cause an autonomic stress response. One is to make someone feel accused. Control questions like ""what is your name?"" are unlikely to make someone feel accused, but when someone knows s/he is being investigated because of being under suspicion, any question relevant to that could feel like an accusation - irrespective of guilt or innocence.

So the results of these tests will depend on personality and circumstances - e.g. has the person been repeatedly accused of things recently, or is the person already near or past his/her limits (e.g. due to unemployment).

And at least one ""personality"" trait makes it easy to beat a lie detector test. Sociopaths don't feel guilt, and don't get the related stress response. To make a sociopath fail a lie detector test, you basically need to do things that would make anyone fail the same test irrespective of guilt - keep them disoriented, take away any sense of control they have, make aggressive threats and accusations, etc.

It *is* possible to detect lying, but it's far from easy. Experienced police are no better at it than everyone else despite what they believe, and people in general believe they are good at spotting liars, but are actually dreadful. The only exceptions are specially trained. It requires paying attention to a lot of non-verbals at once - particularly ""micro-gestures"" which most people don't consciously spot at all. And the key thing isn't to determine if someone is stressed, but if someone is self-monitoring - taking fractionally too long to answer.

Source - various studies as described and summarized [in this book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Detecting-Lies-Deceit-Implications-Professional-ebook/dp/B002C1BD7E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394523104&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=vrij+detecting+lies+and+deceit). Warning - I haven't read the [second edition](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Detecting-Lies-Deceit-Opportunities-Psychology/dp/0470516259/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394523104&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=vrij+detecting+lies+and+deceit) and it's a long while since I read the first - I've tried to avoid going into detail because of the chance of getting those details wrong.

BTW - outside the first few pages, that book is pretty boring. The reason - other than the quick up-front summary of conclusions, the science - methods and results of studies - is always going to be boring.

And that's the problem. People love easy justifications for jumping to conclusions. Reality isn't anywhere near so easy or fun.

No they're not the source of the problem.  The source of the problem is human greed and the excessively consumer oriented culture that we live in. They're just a cog of the whole machinery.

&gt; If you're indeed from the third world, then how do you feel comfortable working for the financial industry that actually keeps the majority of the third world in continuous debt and allows people to starve.

The third world and actually the entire world is in debt because they spend more than what they can make. Its like spending more in your house and blaming the bank for giving you a credit card. The debt on first world countries like USA and UK dwarfs any debt on the third world. This is what the austerity measures are about as well. We're spending far more than what we make each year and have been doing so for decades now. This has gone to a point where we spend a significant part of our budget just repaying the interest on the debt that we have amassed.

They pay massive taxes and are a very good source of income for the country. Just the City of London alone generates a substantial part of our budget. Yes, there were bailouts but the government is going to recover almost everything that they invested. It wasn't a free gift that the media makes it out to be.

I don't, however, believe that Hugo will push a move through unless there is a strong strong push from someone like PSG or Barcelona.  

I still don't get the issue with BAE.  If the problem was truly AVB not rating him/getting along with him, why didn't we recall him during the January window?  I think this was critical mistake, especially given that Rose spent so much time injured during the first half of the season.  My point is I don't see BAE coming back, so we definitely should be in the running for a LB.  That said, I think we have zero chance of getting someone like Shaw or Coentrão as they will be in demand for bigger teams than us.  Same with Schmelzer.

So you thing that the £130bn is the reason for the austerity? Well, do you have any idea of the annual NHS budget? Let me tell you that its around £110bn for 2013/14. 

http://www.nhsconfed.org/priorities/political-engagement/Pages/NHS-statistics.aspx

I don't think it needs a genius to figure out where the cuts are needed. Yes, the bailouts were a blow to the economy but the government definitely fueled the housing crisis and its doing the same right now. The short sightedness of the government and the lack of legislation (the actual job of the government) means that we're building up another housing bubble. The government will recover its investment, maybe at a profit or worse comes worse they'll break even. What then? Will the NHS issues, austerity and all the other problems plaguing the public sector just go away? 

The problem is that Britain has been spending far more than its budget every year for decades. We've amassed such a debt that we spend a substantial part of our annual budget in interest payments alone. We need to stop the spending spree and bring our finances in control.

&gt; Another problem this poses is teams that sit deep. Obviously we are not tiki taca extraordinaire, so when teams basically bunch together and ask us to fuck our selves with our counter attacks, one of the alternatives deployed by possession teams like United (of SAF era - 2007-09), Barca, Bayern etc. is the ability to chip balls / place balls in to the box for one touch shots. We could do this with Mata... but we need to find someone who can do this again (Oscar, Willian, Hazard et. al. - no offence).

I think this is a valid point but it's worth mentioning that the lack of a killer-instinct striker makes these strategies exceptionally hard because defenders only need to focus the winger when he's controlling the tempo (i.e. Hazard / Willian). With a proper striker the defense would naturally have to open up a little to track the added threat properly. When torres plays he's basically just another midfielder. Willian has lacked the finishing and Hazard is left alone to make magic and score. Hazard has become an integral player to our offense not only because of his skill (undeniable) but because Mourinho had to utilize him as the ""killer instinct"" player. He's turning Hazard into a Ronaldo/Messi type player (midfielder playing as a striker). I think with more striking threat the pressure on Hazard can be relieved a little.


That isn't to say he can't handle it, but the biggest problem with this style of play is that it is easily countered with the right players. I think this is also part of the reason we are becoming a second-half team.

Tbf, the reason for that is that we have Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge up front. There are much more experienced, proven strikers in the PL that wouldn't get a look in with those two in their current form. 

Borini has looked okay this season. I'm not convinced he's developed quite as much as people seem to think, but it's hard to say when he's playing for a poor team. He was dire when he played here though, so bringing him back would be risky. Touch wood we'll have European football next season though so if he does come back then we'll be able to see what he can do in the domestic cups and easier PL games.

true,joeflux,null,null,"&gt; Correct me, but my calculations would make them better off buying a cheaper house. 

Your own figures disprove that:

&gt; Summary - 10k (2%) Vs. 8k (4%) 

We don't care about the percentage, only the absolute amounts in your bank account.

So 10k vs 8k.

&gt; and a lot of costs ignored, but a larger house is more expensive to run and maintain, plus stamp duty

Agreed.  Plus a larger council tax, etc.

&gt; I would say that you would be better off from an investment view, to buy smaller

Possibly.  But one other factor is that £500k houses tend to fluctuate in price very drastically - from £400k to £600k, say.  Whereas a £200k house pretty much only grows steadily no matter the economy.  

So depending on when you buy drastically changes the outcome.

Another factor is that the £500k can be refinanced at a lower interest once you've paid off some of it.

&gt; I would say that you would be better off from an investment view, to buy smaller.

Quite possibly.  I personally bought the 200k place instead of the 500k, but that's mostly because I'm fairly risk adverse.",0,1394528191,null,0,false,0,cfzpknw,t3_1ywalm,t1_cfzpknw,t1_cfzbqqn,null,1432750206,2,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,2

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt; There are many ways to cause an autonomic stress response. One is to make someone feel accused. Control questions like ""what is your name?"" are unlikely to make someone feel accused, but when someone knows s/he is being investigated because of being under suspicion, any question relevant to that could feel like an accusation - irrespective of guilt or innocence.

That was the conclusion of the NSA study IIRC. The central tenant of the polygraph, the idea that stress builds towards the lie and then tapers off, is bullshit. Having more accurate ways of measuring stress is therefore irrelevant.

Turns out most of the successful polygraph studies leaned on extra information the polygrapher had available to him.

Great work!

""Tough love"" speech coming up:

Dude, that stuff is shit.  Start treating yourself (several times a day) with apples, oranges and other naturally nummy stuff.  You need to re-train your taste buds so they don't think liquid sugar is a suitable reward.  Otherwise you're gonna spend the rest of your life fighting the sugar urge and being miserable as shit because you're not getting it.

Also, start doing more exercise.  It sucks at first, particularly if you're overweight, but it'll make you feel better in the long run (not just for losing weight - endorphins get released when you exercise and they're powerful anti-depressants).  The more calories you burn exercising, the less you have to diet.

Taking a dog for a walk for an hour a day (or something like that) is a great way to get exercise without noticing that you're actually exercising.  If you haven't got a dog I bet you've got neighbours who might want their dogs walking.  You might even earn a few quid out of it in the process.  And you get to meet people, even if it's only saying ""good morning"" as you pass by.

You'll have to trust me on this, but I do know where you're coming from.

&gt; I'm always too afraid to comment.

Don't be.  We're nice folk around here and you'll always be welcome.

    ""You are a child of the universe, 
     no less than the trees and the stars; 
     you have a right to be here.""

This only began to happen from mid-2013 and for the most part still isn't implemented.

Some very small areas (University professors) have had this slightly earlier. But for the vast majority, progression pay continued during 'austerity'.

Furthermore, considering pay bands in the public sector tend to be HUGE (i.e. Grade X = £19-28k, Grade Z = £28-45k) you can still progress in pay even during the 'freeze' by moving up a band, even for the same job, and for the most part without any performance increase.

When you're in charge of implementing the policy, you'll find ways of making it work for you ;-)

I would say the best way would be to post in your own clubs forums and point them here letting them know that this is a communal league forum and not meant to overtake their own teams but serve as another outlet.

Unfortunately, the attraction of non league lies primarily in the towns which they are played so the fans we do attract will be actual fans that go to actual matches that they are flared for. This is good in terms of quality but not so much in terms of quantity.

Other than that, if your club allows banners why not mock up a quick one that says 'reddit.com/r/conferencefootball' or somesuch and hang it at your next match.

But when he was in charge we were a feared and dangerous team, fast attacking and full of heart and passion. People talk about AVB being some tactical genius but its simply not true. He also ""had no plan b"" His plan A was pass it sideways until it gets to Bale (or even Dempsey who was also great). The fact he tried to take credit for Bale's ability when he won his award was a god damned joke in my eyes.

AVB also had the audacity to try claim that players were bought without his consent, but this only came out when things weren't going well. Don't get me wrong, after being very vocal in my dislike of his appointment i was supportive and hopeful of his success (like i am with every coach and player we've had - Even Gross!) But people's love of AVB on this Sub is confusing to me.

I'm just hoping that Tim can sort it out, but im not confident he's there just yet. I'd hate to see him leave, as i think he would make a great no.2 to Van Gaal and learn his trade some more from a genuine master of the game.

Credit - forbidden by law, except when there are ""national security"" get-outs.

References - it is implied that, when you supply a reference, your prospective employer may follow it up. However, in my opinion references will not exist in 10 years' time; in my organisation they are only obtained as a matter of form by HR after the job offer is accepted and I am fairly sure, because of the number of HR staff there are, that they cannot be and are not followed up systematically. (Because of a number of reasons, most notably a number of defamation cases where an employer wrote something that they could not prove when challenged, references are as bland as can be imagined nowadays - literally ""Joe Bloggs worked for Acme Widgets plc between X and Y and discharged his duties satisfactorily during that time"" - so are of little value).

Education - as with References; the followup would be by HR.

Job history - forbidden. Even if a candidate reapplies after a previous stint with my employer, their old employee records are off limits. I believe that, like all business records, they are kept for a maximum of 7 years after they were produced, then destroyed. I may check with current staff who knew the candidate during their previous stint but will keep the result of that check from the interviewers; it will only be used if the outcome of the interview is inconclusive, which should not happen.

I suspect that the [Information Commissioner](http://ico.org.uk) is the point of contact for data protection issues here, as with everywhere.

Some 30,000 have made such a journey to Africa and have been offered generous settlement packages, but lack of citizenship rights for their children is causing difficulties;

This makes sense, after all by returning they should be 'native' again?

&gt;devise a development strategy to help improve the lives of poor communities in the Caribbean still devastated by the after-effects of slavery;

bloody hell... Slavery was abolished like 200 years ago, surely you could have got over it by now?

&gt; support cultural exchanges between the Caribbean and west Africa to help Caribbean people of African descent rebuild their sense of history and identity;

So basically you want to bring African Culture to the Carribean?

&gt;back literacy drives designed to improve education levels that are still dire in many Caribbean communities;

Surely this is your own Govts responsibility? just like every other country works to improve it's own literacy?

&gt;provide medical assistance to the region that is struggling from high levels of chronic diseases such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes that the Caricom reparations commission links to the fallout from slavery.

Again this is basic healthcare, surely their own Govts should be resolving this?

This is totally standard, so many rumors get posted that have no truth- even on the official site. 

7th March-  links the Blues with a £6million swoop for Valencia midfielder Carles Gil.

23rd Feb- claim Martinez is interested in bringing Joe Allen across Stanley Park from Liverpool.

21st feb- the Toffees are linked with a summer move for former West Ham star Valon Behrami. Inter Milan are also thought to be interested in the 28-year-old Swiss.

while The Times claim the Blues have held talks with Ajax defender Niklas Moisander

 According to the paper, Celtic’s Emilio Izaguirre, Dundee United’s Andy Robertson and Valencia’s Sergio Canales are all mentioned with possible switches to Everton. John Heitinga is also said to be interesting Galatasaray and Roma.

Elsewhere, another tabloid has linked Feyenoord defender Bruno Martins Indi with an £8million move to Goodison Park.

I find the term ""driverless"" a bit confusing.

Does driverless just mean that? That's obviously already in progress, with the Northern line due next. I don't think that has anything to do with unions (the Victoria line was driverless in this sense from the start).

Or does it mean *unstaffed* i.e. no person at the front of the train at all? I'm not sure whether this is a good idea. If it does happen, then yes this is probably a reaction against unions.

Edit: There was a speech Boris Johnson gave that got widely reported as him wanting ""driverless trains"".

true,Milemarker80,null,null,"As another NHS type, we're seeing something similar locally - although caused by a different problem entirely.  Shifting of funding locally from management to the clinical front line and from in hospital acute services to community nursing has actually caused a rise in the number of nursing posts, and we're having real problems filling these extra posts with suitable staff.  It's not a decrease in funding we're seeing - it's the exact opposite, but still with the same effects - there's just not enough staff to fill the increased number of posts.

The reasons for this are mostly threefold.
1) Wrong 'type' of nurse.  As nursing and medical care in general moves from the hospital setting to the community, we're having real issues finding community matrons and nurses with community experience.
2) Lack of quality nurses.  Sadly, the profession is just not what it used to be - the pay is terrible, the hours bad and the professions reputation is constantly put down in the press.  The 'best' people are just not attracted to the profession anymore and this will be impacting even further over the next few years.
3) Gentrification.  Linked to the above, our local area has seen some of the highest housing price rises in London and there's just no way a nurse, any nurse could afford a mortgage locally by themselves (or even with a partner at an average wage).  Recruiting clinical staff when they can no longer to live near / access easily the hospital site that they work shifts at is becoming much more challenging, with a noticeable drop in the number of applications for most positions.

Almost amusingly, linked to the last point is that our A&amp;E has also lost its reputation as one of London's best trauma centres, with a huge decrease in knife crime and gang related violence.

There's overpaying and there's *overpaying*, and I think going a couple million over what we might have wanted to in order to seal the deal quickly is acceptable, and something we haven't really been doing enough of at times (Salah, for example).

I think we need all of those things. But building new houses takes time (and probably never would meet demand), so it seems fair that someone who patently does not need a council house should get kicked out of it in order to make the best use out of what we have.

&gt; the average earner who struggles to pay their private rent or mortgage should not have to risk repossession or eviction, they would most most certainly get my sympathy

You probably don't work in the courts or at a mortgage lender making the final decision to allow repossession, so your sympathy doesn't matter and it won't stop people getting kicked out of their houses. Meanwhile people like Crow had no real risk of losing their property despite their wealth, and I don't see why he is any more special than the people who are clinging on to their homes.

He earnt several times the average wage. Do you really think he'd be homeless and couldn't rent or buy a fairly nice place? This is the key factor, and you're conflating it with just about any other council house occupier who clearly doesn't have the means.

Did you not read the article?

Benedict Cumberbatch's family owned the Cleland Plantation on Bardados, home to 250 slaves, for 3 or 4 generations until the abolition of slavery. 

This made them ""one of the richest families in the country"" ([Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2549773/How-Benedict-Cumberbatchs-family-fortune-slavery-And-roles-films-like-12-Years-A-Slave-bid-atone-sins.html)) and afforded them a stately home in Somerset. Cumberbatch's grandfather, a naval officer during WWII is described as ""a prominent figure of London high-society"". Combined with Cumberbatch's attendance at a £33,000 per year public school, I think it's safe to say that some wealth has been inherited through the generations.

I absolutely do not think that Cumberbatch, or his parents or grandparents, or any individual, should be held personally responsible for slavery or reparations.

But your argument is just fucking nonsense, and it illustrates how those who would deny responsibility for slavery will just make things up in order to cry ""not our fault"". You didn't know whether slave-owning families might be possible to trace, so you just assumed not, and claimed it as if it were a fact. You were wrong, but that doesn't matter, because you're arguing from emotion and bias, anyway.

I'll reiterate: I don't think any living individual should be held responsible for slavery or reparations, but as a nation we certainly did profit.

When I say that I think inherited wealth inequality is wrong, I get called all kinds of a socialist and told that ""it's my property to do what I like with when I die"". Why does that go only one way? Why do we get to inherit the wealth, without the responsibility?

I don't think that bags of cash will fix the problem, but I think we should at least have the courtesy to listen to what the Caribbean nations have to say, and help out where we can.

He's not a brilliant manager (yet anyway), and he's been suddenly thrown in the deep end by a chairman with no clear plan other than the need to abruptly sack AVB without any idea if there was a suitable candidate available to take over.

So Sherwood's been stuck with a dysfunctional, injury-prone squad with confidence at its lowest ebb in years, without having the time or preparation to have a long term plan other than ""hopefully get top four"".

He was never ever going to be a long term solution, but the lack of a viable candidate - and some good early results - forced Levy's hand into a non-committal 18 month contract... too long for him to be viewed as a simple caretaker with little pressure for results, but too short to be taken seriously by the squad.

The team needs a massive kick up the arse both in terms of tactical discipline and confidence, and having them all know implicitly Tim ain't gonna be there after the World Cup is a ridiculous situation where no one is going to take his ideas that seriously.  The season is already a bit of a lost cause for us, and at least a permanent manager would be able to start experimenting and implementing ideas on the pitch.  But instead, whatever tinkering or refining he does is going to amount to nothing, because the whole team will be once again rebooted over the summer anyway.

Arguably, we're better now than we were with Torres but when he was with us, when he was 'El Nino,' he gave us his all and created some really memorable moments.  I've got a soft spot for him as a result and I'd like to see him regain some of that form--maybe back in Spain.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt; The transatlantic slave trade was still happening in the last 150 years; a similar timescale to my other examples.

Hence the question 'how far back to you want to go?'. And how do you justify all the other atrocities etc. seeing as they'll all need compensation too.

&gt;What does the Mongolian empire have to do with anything? 

They killed millions. You are aware that there have been a number of empires conquering and enslaving, yes? Google is your friend..

&gt; I'm saying that descendants of victims of the transatlantic slave trade should receive reparations, not ""all people who descend from victims of the state at any point in history should receive reparations"". 

And I'm illustrating that if you allow this, it doesn't stop there. So you now have to demonstrate why your compensation is legitimate, while all those others aren't.

&gt;In any case, the state can and does compensate victims including individuals of its crimes in the past. See thalidomide.

Again, from the last hundred years. And now you're including stuff that's outside your own stated scope - unless you think thalidomide was actually a part of some evil slavery plot.

&gt;See the many examples resulting from South American colonial expansion, such as in Chile and Argentina.

Don't tell the Argentines that, they're still complaining about the Falklands while ignoring their own heritage. But again, we're back to considering Spain paying out, which would then mean the Moors have to pay Spain (unless you think Spaniards have dark eyes and hair by chance).

&gt; It's a very common practice and why victims of slavery, which black people have been suffering from for centuries 

Errr...it's a bit more varied than 'black people'. And it's *suffered*, not suffering. Just one example - a number of territories used to kidnap Britons for slavery. Unless you can give a set date before which all claims are ignored, it's open season for stuff like this.

&gt;despite huge amounts of historical precedence is a very legitimate question.

Huge amounts? Do give examples of financial reparations from events over 200 years ago - But not until;

* you've explained how the concern of slavery is valid but all the other examples I gave aren't, in terms of reparations.

* Why the historical context (kids up chimneys, etc.) is irrelevant - but remember than if you assert as such, we can prosecute the Africans for using voodoo instead of real medicine and costing lives

* How the African territories can compensate each other

* At what date you think we should ignore previous claims

* To what degree to we fine countries that have insisted on refusing more advanced setups (science, government, etc.) and so on for the loss of life they've caused.

See, it's easy to decide that you're owed money for something that was done to your great great great grandfather - but fortunately, we tend not to do that because it would simply go on forever (hence, to use one of your examples, we aren't still itching to fight Germany).",0,1394544412,null,0,1394549920,0,cfzske1,t3_203xv4,t1_cfzske1,t1_cfzs4y9,null,1432751615,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Aygers,lfc99,,"Rodgers is also having a very good season. There have been some games where he made mistakes but in general his management of the team has been superb.

Pretty much everyone in the team who was also playing last season has improved, bar maybe Coutinho and Agger (who haven't been worse just not a lot better). His transfer dealings weren't all great, though we did get in Sakho who could go on to be our player for a decade (fingers crossed), Mignolet is having a solid, if unspectacular season. Other newcomers haven't really done much of note. 

Other big achievements: top scoring team of the PL, consistent performances for a majority of the current season, got Sterling back into the team even better than he was last year, Gerrard reinvented and looking like he could go on playing for years, another quality player from the academy is in the first team (Flano), with a couple others getting a look in here and there as well ... Suarez is happy and also still at Liverpool! That shouldn't be discounted. Seems to be doing a wonderful job man-managing pretty much every player at the club currently. 

I was also impressed with how things have been going after the winter transfer window. Everyone knew we wanted to reinforce, there were targets, there were failures (again unfortunately), yet he's come out of that period with a good run of performances from the team looking better than ever this season. Quite amazing when you consider everything that was going on in january.

If he and his team deliver a win this week vs. ManU I really don't know what else we could ask for. We're looking good for the top four, got a decent run in, looks like a possible party end to the season for us. One thing I do regret is not having better cup runs. Also a couple of games could have had better results (Hull away, Swansea away, Aston Villa and Southampton at home).

However I don't really agree on our signings.  I agree Eriksen, Vlad, and Lamela are ones for the future, though disagree that Eriksen hasn't been great.  He has been.  I think Chadli is very useful, and our best option on the left at the moment.  My defense of Soldado is also well documented on here I think.  Capoue and Paulinho I won't really argue with.  Both started great but haven't shown much since.

And nothing he says about Van Gaal strikes me as a problem.  If he is coming in, he'll have communicated to Levy what types of players he wants to bring in.  I don't know what fans don't like squad rotation.  I've yet to see a supporter who likes having an exhausted squad coming out of January.

As for Sherwood in/out, even though I did say AVB should have had more time, I have no problem saying I'd rather see Sherwood gone or in some other role.  I didn't turn on him, because I was never sold on him.   I just don't see what he's brought that actually makes us play better on the pitch.

Doesn't fill me with faith.

I found the first film to perfectly display why adapting something that works with a short run time isn't always the best option. The film dragged on, repeated a lot of the same jokes and the plot was thin to the point of non-existence. 

Not to mention there were some scenes that would've really been improved with a better/actually noticeable score. A lot of the more awkward moments became too awkward as they were either lacking music altogether or what was there either didn't fit the scene or was so minimal that it might as well not have been there.

In all honesty it feels like *The Inbetweeners* has run its course and is just being milked though. If they didn't have much to put into the first film (the entire thing was basically a collection of coming of age/young Brits abroad tropes) then I can't see the sequel providing very much.

A mortgage is a big deal and you really need to be prepared mentally and financially. In between getting all the documents together, fighting with agents, sellers, conveyancing and then any work that needs doing. You really need to have your game face on.  We bought a place two years ago and I really underestimated how much stress it was. 

**Secondly, no mortgage company will give you a mortgage when you have no income.** So forget that.  It would be entirely up to your SO. What if he has to stop working all of a sudden? How would you cope financially? 

Furthermore, if you're credit history is bad, you really need to sort that out. Once April rolls around, mortgage companies will have to be pickier in what deals they can offer. They will 'stress' test your finances so to speak. If you have a dodgy credit rating, getting a mortgage is already hard enough - it'll get harder from April. What exactly is wrong with it? It's hard to imagine how it can be out of your control, but I guess these things can happen. But that's not how lenders see things. It's pretty much a computer deciding so you have to be squeaky clean. 

If I were you, I would concentrate your efforts into feeling better, and instead of concentrating on house searching and mortgages -  when you feel better, get steady work and fix your credit rating. After 6 months in a job you'll be in a much better place to buy - and you can will probably be able to get that extra 10k you clearly want.

A tale of a fateful trip
That started from this tropic planet
Aboard this blue ship.

The mate was a mighty companion,
The skipper brave and sure.
Three passengers set sail that day
For a Time lord tour, a Time lord tour.

The TARDIS started getting rough,
The Blue ship was tossed,
If not for the courage of the fearless crew
The TARDIS would be lost, the TARDIS would be lost.

The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted Planet
With Amy
The Doctor too,
The Rory and his father,
The Donna Noble
The professor and Martha,
Here on Trenzalore.


So this is the tale of the travelers,
They're here for a long, long time,
They'll have to make the best of things,
It's an uphill climb.

true,everlongz,lfc12,,"Question 1 Lets get it out of the way, what are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season who has moved from your local rivals to your biggest rivals in football?


I think United are performing as expected. SAF have been having the team over performing for years if you look at the quality of players. 
When you hire a manager that is only able to place 6th you will get 6th. In my opinion the work Moyes had been doing at Everton was way over rated.


Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?
Realistic would be top 4.
Optimistic would be tittle contender at this point.


But if you asked me before the season conteder for top 4 would be realistic and top 4 optimistic. 



Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.


Suarez will stay 100% if we get top 4 (which we will).
I don't really know about players, but I'd like to see someone like Luke Shaw in. Don't think it's likekly tho 


Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?

Evra. Take a guess why.


Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?


Rogers is doing a fantastic job and have been doing this since he got the job. If you say that this season is ""capitalising on United's weakness"" you got no idea what you are talking about. Stupid question in my opinion.


Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?

1-4 at Old Trafford back in 09. Because it made us look like real contenders for the title.



Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?

1-4, and we'll look like real contenders for the title, again.



Question 8 Where do you think both clubs will finish in the league this season.

Liverpool will likely finish from 3-4. United will finish at 6.

Rooney. No idea why, just Rooney.

&gt;Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?

We were improving even when you lot won the league, albeit at a slower pace. We're what I call title dark horses at the moment, give us another year or three and I believe we will be challenging for the league.

&gt;Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?

4-1 Gerrard kiss cam. Vidic still has nightmares!

&gt;Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?

I never have predictions on these games because it's one of those fixtures where form goes out the window. If I had to guess, 4-2 Liverpool win.

&gt;Question 8 Where do you think both clubs will finish in the league this season.

2: Finish in the top 4

3: I think Suarez will stay and while I dont have any specific names in mind, I think all reds fans would like to see at least 1 new CB, a LB, and a first-team quality winger, perhaps Kono. 

4: Ryan Giggs for fucking his brother's wife. Van Persie is a close second for just being a general horrible cunt. Phil Jones because he looks like Sloth from the Goonies.

5: Is that even a question? 74 goals in 28 games. Best shot at a return to Europe's elite in years... in his second season.

6: Kuyt's hat trick or the 4-1 at OT. Suarez's performance in that game was absolutely brilliant. 

7: It's going to be flying. I think Liverpool will capitalize on that and take all the points. 

8: Liverpool will finish 3rd and United will finish 6th and be plagued with Europa league next season.

Does this mean the answer is to ask the government to force banks into dealing with Bitcoin businesses? That sounds like a very unpleasant two-edged sword for Bitcoin, and it is not terribly libertarian to use force against banks.

If anything, the problem is regulations in the first place, such as anti-money-laundering ones which force banks into taking such an interest in who we are and what we do with our money, instead of just processing the payments. Such regulations have noble intent, I am sure, but here we see how they have unintended consequences -- crippling a new kind of business.

A hardline socialist friend of mine raised a good point about this a little while ago, which is that the coalmining industry that Thatcher destroyed is something that's been eulogised without merit. Coalmines weren't happy places to work. They were dangerous, dirty, painful, seriously unhealthy, and seemingly everyone in them hated working there, but did so out of that working class work ethic to work hard, and to provide for their families. The point he made was that Thatcher didn't actually do a bad thing by killing them off. The problems were the damage done to the communities, and that nothing was ever introduced to replace the mines.

1) I hate a lot of your players, but as a defender I have a lot of respect for Vidic since he's just so damn good. Moyes I feel has been unlucky this season. I don't think he was right to step into SAF's shoes, but I don't think he did a horrible job at Everton before moving, and had some success man-managing there. I guess his tactics in the dressing room just didn't translate to the big screen and you guys are suffering heavily because of it.

2) It's a dream to win the league, but I'd be happy (though slightly diisappointed) with 3rd. I came into this season thinking we would be struggling for 4th against equal or better opposition, but in the games that counted we've put on a master class and now here we are.

3) I think if we finish top 3, Suarez will stay. That might be a little optimistic but if he goes, I hope we part ways amicably and without the bullshit that Torres went through. I'd like to see BR fix up our defending a little bit, and give us some depth as wel.

4) It's a tie between Evra because of the whole Suarez incident, and Fellaini for being a Manc cunt AND an Everton cunt. Probably Evra though

5) It's not just United's weakness he's preying on to turn us into contenders. You guys are 7th and we're 3rd, that means we're also above Arsenal, Everton, and Tottenham. I think it's a mix of BR's tactics that have finally settled in the team, and SAS(AS)'s incredible run of form that have put us in the top.

6) 2009 Liverpool 4-1 United, no doubt lol. Torres merking Vidic and Fabio Aurelio's free kick sent me crazy, and the fact that it was at Old Trafford makes it 10x sweeter. Wish it was a clean sheet

But the longer you have him, the more long term damage he does so I say he is doing a tremendous job and should be offered a new 6 year contract extension.

2. Second is a possibility. Third is most likely, I think. Fourth is a certainty. Finishing above Arsenal or City would be fantastic considering we finished 7th last season.

3. Suarez will stay with us in the Champions League. Nobody will pay his release clause in his new contract. Not even Real. I don't know about any player in particular who I'd like us to sign. I'd just like increased depth to the squad.

**Question 1 Lets get it out of the way, what are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season who has moved from your local rivals to your biggest rivals in football?**

I hate you, I hate your stinking guts, you could be in the championship and I'd still feel this way, it's a passionate hate. I never disliked Moyes at Everton, I respected his ability to work with penny's and constantly compete in the premier league, as for Moyes at united, it's obvious he's out of his depth, he can still probably constantly compete in the premier league, but nowhere near the title. So in short, I fucking love Moyes at united. My opinion is that the only possible way for united to start to look like a force again would be to hire a new, younger manager. In the blueprint of Klopp at Dortmund and Rodgers at Liverpool, and I guess even Matinez at Everton. Someone young and adaptive, but I hope to fuck they don't and get their fair share of Hodgson's.

**Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?**

Top 3 and anywhere above that would be taken. Ofcourse it's not 'realistic' to imagine us going undefeated to the end of the season, but it's not out the realms of possibility as we're looking stronger every game. 

**Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.**

Yes and Kroos, just to fuck you off. 

**Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?**

Evra, because he's charlatan
 
**Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?**

He's capitalising on our strengths, not your weakness. We beat Arsenal 5-1 and Tottenham 5-0. We're a strong fucking team and it's only really forward from here, UCL will make us a lot fucking better. 

**Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?**

4-1
Kiss the screen Stevie

**Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?**

It's anyones game really, you're at home, we're in form.

Question 8 Where do you think both clubs will finish in the league this season.

we'll finish 2nd and you lot 21st

Different schools offer different subjects  - usually about fifteen from ages 11-13, including History, Geography, Art, Music, Home Economics, PE, Technology, Computing, Business, and languages. 

The first major exams (GCSEs) are taken at age 16. Most students take nine subjects. English and Mathematics are mandatory; most schools also require Science and Religious Studies, and the rest are free choice.

After GCSEs, students can either continue formal education with A-Levels. These are two-year, six-module courses that look at subjects in more depth. The first three modules are called the AS block; the latter three are called A2. Most people take four subjects for AS at age 17, and only continue three of them for the A2 exams the following year. 

A-Level subjects are usually chosen with university entry in mind. I wanted to go to medical school, and knew I would need As in Chemistry and Biology, plus top grades in my other two subjects. I took Politics and History as I wanted some balance between the sciences and humanities. From speaking to students who've been through other exam systems (e.g. the International Baccalaureate or the Irish Leaving Certificate), some are of the opinion that limiting advanced study to three or four subjects prevents students from gaining a rounded education.

There is also criticism within the industry that the modular system is too exam-focussed and doesn't give students a broad understanding of the subject. Students are able to resit modules within their two-year course to achieve the best possible mark, and some say this gives students too many chances to get good grades.",0,1394550490,null,0,false,0,cfzupwo,t3_1zz9d1,t1_cfzupwo,t3_1zz9d1,null,1432752696,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"1. I'm delighted with United this year. SAF is an all-time great (in terms of as a manager, bit of a cunt otherwise) and papered over the cracks at MU for years. I also think it's hilarious how irresponsibly the Glazers have run United, but they've always had the value of the club, which is astronomical, to rely on to cover their debt. The only thing that can really damage the value is underachieving for a sustained period, and it doesn't look good at the moment. I'm pretty happy with this. Moyes always was an overrated manager and only ever succeeded at stay comfortable adjacent to success at Everton. Tactically, he is Hodgson-esque and a disaster. Tl;dr - best manager United have ever had.

2. Realistically, we're looking at 4th or 3rd. Optimistically, we'll push Chelsea and City for the title until the last few weeks.

3. I think Suarez is staying with CL football, and that is looking rather good. I would love to add a winger or outside forward and a fullback in the window. Not sure who is realistic at the moment, though.

4. I don't care for Evra, but that is probably not a PC response in the football community. RVP is also a huge twat and not as good as anyone, especially he, thinks.

5. Rodgers looks like a great manager. He has a clear, but open, philosophy and is willing to change his mind on players and tactics after seeing hard evidence. I couldn't be much happier with him and hope he is here for a long time.

6. Got to be the 4-1 at OT.

true,smushkan,eng-Surrey,Guildford,"Nicotine is a very [potent poison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine_poisoning) - hence why the plant produces it in order to kill off pests.

Nictoine has an LD50 of 0.5-1.0 mg/kg intravenously, which is the point at which half the people who take that dose will die - i.e. the average lethal dose. In comparison, diamorphene (*Pure* heroin) has an LD50 of [~22mg/kg IV](http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/pharm/pim261f.htm).

There is enough nicotine in *two cigarettes (~60mg)* to kill you - assuming you could extract it all perfectly and it was all absorbed directly into your bloodstream. In reality, the vast majority of it gets destroyed, and the dose received via smoking is only a couple of milligrams. 

The common higher-strength Vape liquid is [2.4mg/ml](http://www.vapehit.co.uk/info.php?articles&amp;articles_id=22), and is frequently sold in containers of 100ml. If injected, you would receive four times the lethal dose. It's not pure nicotine, but it's very potent.

If you swallowed the lot, the bioavailability of nicotine orally ingested is up to [45%](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bioavailability+nicotine+oral&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=fflb&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=LiYfU9e2IY-f7ga26oGQBg), so drinking a 100ml bottle could still potentially give 1.8 times the lethal dose.

*TL:DR - Nicotine liquid is pretty poisonous stuff if used incorrectly, and should be treated with care.*

4. Would be quicker to list the ones i don’t hate, but top of the list is still Evra you know why.

5. I really don’t think our season has anything to do with your weakness we are playing great right now and we would still be around the top if you where. That said, if we can keep the team and build upon it we should be right up there for next few years. Only thing that can stop us IMO is if we don’t add more debt to the team and/or if we start selling our top players.

You make near enough 100M more per year than your closest rival and yet they spend very little on the squad comparatively.  I also think Rooney signing an extension was a mistake, as were the purchases of Mata and Fellani.  Frankly I think you need a better, more visionary manager than Moyes.  Maybe Bielsa or Klopp, as examples.  You have enough money that winning the league should be near enough a foregone conclusion every year or at the very least challenging.
2.  I expected to come in 5th at the start, but am quite happy with anything in the top 4.
3.  Whether Suarez will stay or not has far more to do with whether anyone has the wherewithal to bid on him or not than anything else I think.
4.  I really don't hate any particular player, but Van Persie has turned into a bit of a shit.  ""No one leaves me space, wah, wah, wah"".  Frankly you seem to play better with him off the pitch lately using Rooney up front anyway.
5.  Rodgers loves the game and is a good tactician.  His man management is decent, particularly for the younger players.  His signings though are a bit woeful and I do wish he would rotate the squad more sometimes.  Title contenders will be tough and we're not quite at that level yet, I don't think.
6.  I love them all.  It's always a great occasion.
7.  I think we'll win, but it'll be close.  Honestly we're both somewhat inconsistent so it could really go either way depending on which team shows up for the game.

true,LordKurin,lfc99,,"&gt;Question 1 Lets get it out of the way, what are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season who has moved from your local rivals to your biggest rivals in football?

I am amazed that Moyes is still your coach honestly.  United didn't barely eke out victory last year. They were dominant all season long and won the league by 11 points. At the beginning of this season everyone predicted that United would win again because the ""squad would only be better. They were young last year and have had another year to mature.""  Now suddenly since they are losing under Moyes they are a terrible squad who ""miraculously"" won the league? I'd be more likely to buy someone talking about how A) the rest of the league got substantially better while they did not and B) Injuries have hurt them this year. But my counter to that argument is that they quite simply do not look like a good team anymore. 82 crosses in a game doesn't mean the players suddenly forgot how to pass through the middle, it means the coach doesn't know how to coach them to play that way.  In my opinion Moyes is out of his depth.  He was a decent coach at a mid-table club who's tactics were based around beating the bad teams and trying to get lucky against the good teams.  Now suddenly he is expected to beat everyone.  If (a very large question), he can figure out why the mindset that has worked for him his entire life is wrong, he can adjust and be decent because the players seem to like playing for him.  But he's not a young coach and changing mindsets is difficult to do.


&gt;Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?

At the beginning of the year I expected to be in a season long fight for 4th position.  Right now I honestly believe that we are in contention for the title, but we are more likely to finish in 2nd or 3rd simply because Chelsea has to screw up for us to pass them, and we would need to play perfectly.

&gt;Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign?

Assuming we make top 4, I really do think he will stay.  I would be very disappointed if he left.  I would love to sign Kroos, but that's a long shot.  I think that Subotic from Dortmand would be a brilliant addition.

&gt;Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?

Van Persie seems like a cunt and it's even more annoying because he's so good and wins you guys so many games.  :)

&gt;Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?

I believe that Rodgers is definitely turning us into genuine title contenders and I don't think the fall of United has affect that.  I do think that this is an odd season with 3 of the top 4 from last season changing managers and that has ""accelerated"" our success.  That said, my main concern about staying this high is if we can afford to keep pace.  Everyone in the PL is making money and buying great players ATM.

&gt;Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?

Honestly, I've only been following for about 5 years, but even though there have been more ""exciting"" games, the one that stands out to me the most is the first one this season.  Beating you guys 1-0 and winning 3 straight to start the year made me go from pessimistic to optimistic about what we could accomplish this season, esp since it was the type of game that we would normally lose the last few years.

&gt;Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?

Given both teams defensive proclivities to make mistakes, I'm going to say 7-5 Liverpool.  :)

&gt;Question 8 Where do you think both clubs will finish in the league this season?

Suck my balls, also I'm loving it but you'll probably fire him and get some amazing manager because you are a bunch of jammy bastards.

&gt; Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?

Always thought we would be fighting for fourth, but realistically I think we can finish 3rd.

&gt; Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.

Don't know, don't care either, Sturridge has come good and if we sell him then we can get some defensive midfielders who actually defend, also we could get better fullbacks.

All of you especially Evra. The cunt.

&gt; Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?

Hardly owes his success to United, United didn't make him ground down Arsenal, Spurs and Everton (Cunts).

4-1 at OT (The shithole) with Stevie G kissing the camera in front of you cunts (cunts).

3. Assuming that we do make the top 4, then yes. I'd like another wide AM/winger. Konoplyanka or Griezmann (perhaps a little unrealistic, given the demand for him) or Lallana sound good to me, but many of our best signings have been of player I have hardly heard of. I want someone else for that position. A new fullback or two and a new centre back are also needed. 

4. Don't really despise any current United players at the moment.

1. If you alternate the *build quality* of the housing, this is uneconomical purely on the grounds of construction cost and complexity;

2. If you have a consistent build quality of the housing and artificially mix the tenants' socio-economic status then:

    **a.** If it is higher than average, it could be seen as unfair that council tenants pay subsidised rent/no rent to live in a high spec property.

    **b.** If it is lower than average, people who can afford a better property will move elsewhere.

What we have now is not ideal but with the right regulations it can work. The buildings are more or less the same, but in the council flats, the situation of the building is slightly less desirable, and the furnishing quality is generally more utilitarian.

Here is the quote from the BBC.

And that is, that if you look at the figures for the whole of the period under study, 1995-2011, immigration has been a drain on the public purse. To the tune of about £95bn.

Other speculated targets have included Costa, whose price I suspect will soar after the World Cup, Cavani, Falcao, Mandzukic, and most recently Balotelli. Falcao, Cavani, and Mandzukic are all 27 or 28 (near the peak of their careers) and all risk being on the pricey side. In terms of FFP and the long-term project, they might not necessarily be the wisest buys. 

Of the potential targets, I think only Costa and Balotelli are likely in terms of their age (25 and 23 years old, respectively) and the long-term project. I don't think Atleti would sell Costa without Courtois entering the discussion, so that might spoil things. Maybe the idea of finally taming Balotelli would tickle Jose's ego?

We clearly won't sell him to an EPL side and the only ones who could afford the fee we'd ask are PSG, Real, Barca, Bayern, and Monaco.  Of the lot Bayern already brought in Lewa, Barca probably won't be looking for a forward, Ligue 1 is a large step down, so Real is the only one that makes sense.

4. None of them really, not since Gary Neville.  Not particularly warm to Evra either though.

5. BR is having a superb season and really shaping the squad well, love the guy.  Look at how far he's brought players like Henderson and Sterling in such a short amount of time.  He's building a solid squad that will be able to contend for quite some time but we have to be careful to not set expectations too high too quickly.  Just a few years ago we were within days of administration and you don't bounce back from that instantly.  BR seems to know this and has Liverpool on a steady path back up to prominence.

I don't think he particularly wants to go but if the club isn't progressing at the same rate that he is (and one could argue that we're actually starting to slip backwards) then he's not wrong for considering his options.

People talk about the quality Spurs have bought in the last five years but it's more important to look at the players we've sold. Modric, Bale, Berba; all world class.  We've already established that we will sell if the price is right. We can't now blame our best guys for starting to think about where they might go if they can't progress with us (which is what Verts said he wanted to do).",0,1394553735,null,0,false,0,cfzw1q1,t3_204ni0,t1_cfzw1q1,t3_204ni0,null,1432753322,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,cathartis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"There are several issues with online postal voting:

Firstly it's quite hard to prove identity online - especially given the likelihood of things like fishing emails, keyboard loggers etc. Combine that with the low intelligence of some voters, and the fact that this system is likely to only be used once per year or so, so there will be plenty of legitimate cases of people forgetting passwords, pin numbers etc between uses, and there's plenty that can go wrong.

Secondly, we would need to have absolute trust in whichever body or company was chosen to administer this system, since that group would be in a very powerful position to influence the outcome of an election, and hence the future of the entire country. That's not idle speculation - many claim it has already happened in US national elections. Just do a web search for the words ""Diebold Fraud"".

And thirdly, any such system would need to be designed to defend against ""Man in the middle"" attacks. This would involve someone with access to internet infrastructure running a program that placed itself between your PC and the voting site, pretended to be the voting site, and submitting any information that is typed in onwards to the real voting site with a few of the votes strategically changed. This could be done by your ISP, or one of the companies running the infrastructure of the internet, or by GCHQ, or just by anyone else who paid the right bribe to the right techie.

In other words, getting this right would be highly complex and not something I'd trust to a bunch of Politicians and Civil Servants who have a long history of failed IT projects.",0,1394553871,null,0,1394554397,0,cfzw3ts,t3_203vd7,t1_cfzw3ts,t1_cfzsls7,null,1432753349,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

**Question 1: Thoughts on Man U/Moyes**

I don't like your team and seeing you struggling so hard is certainly enjoyable, but I don't hate the humans connected to your club (players/fans).  There seems to be so much more personal hate in Europe than here in the US, even compared to the huge rivalries (Yankees/RedSox, Celtics/Lakers) and I just don't understand hating a neighbor just cause he likes a different sports team.  Rivalries are always better when both teams are playing well, so I would prefer a flip-flop of 2009 to the current situation, but I won't complain.  As for Moyes, give the guy some time and make some of the players take some responsibility.  Even being managed by Helen Keller, you should have enough talent to hang around 4th and the fact that you aren't is more a statement on your players' mental toughness than your coaches, in my opinion.

**Question 2: Expectations**

REALISTICALLY, I don't think we are better than Chelsea or Man City, but the schedule is such that I think we will finish higher than Arsenal.  If I had to put money on an outcome, I would bet 3rd, but if you gave me reasonable odds I could see 1st.  We have Chelsea/Mancity at home, after all,

**Question 3: Suarez stays/signings**

I think if we end up in the Champions league he stays.  He is too good and in his prime to not play on that stage.  I think he is more valuable to Liverpool than any other team that would look to acquire him.  I would like to sign all sorts of players.  I will say that out of YOUR players (ManU) I would be most interested in Kagawa.  I think he would fit in perfectly.

**Question 4: Most hated ManU player**

I don't think I hate as hard as the English fans.  I hated Ronaldo, but he's not current.  Currently, I really don't like any of your defenders, Ferdinand, Vidic or Evra.  Historically, I don't think I'm connected enough to the rivalry to hate people I never saw play.

**Question 5: Rodgers thoughts**

He is not having a fluke year.  He turned around the team hard, getting rid of marginal players and bringing in some that really fit the system well.  We only have a couple that are old enough to expect a drop off soon, so I think we are positioned well for the future as well.  You could see the improvement last year as well and this year we are actually getting the results.  In addition, he has a style that creates numbers, which players really like and could increase the attractiveness of Liverpool to transfers.  Come here, get goals.

**Question 6: Favorite Man U Game**

The 4-1 is an obvious choice.  In retrospect I also am proud of the 1-1 draw two seasons ago since, had you taken all the points from us it would have been enough for you to win the league.

**Question 7: Predictions**

2-3 Liverpool, but far from comfortable.  I think it will be 2-2 at one point before the go-ahead goal.  It always seems like a toss-up against you.

**Question 8: Where will both clubs finish**

If I had to bet, I would say Liverpool 3rd, Man U 6th.  If I had my way, Liverpool 1st, Man U I-don't-fucking-care-we-won-the-league.",0,1394554125,null,0,1394554332,0,cfzw7uz,t3_2050vx,t1_cfzw7uz,t3_2050vx,null,1432753402,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Question 1 Lets get it out of the way, what are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season who has moved from your local rivals to your biggest rivals in football?

I can't see United being this bad next season when they've made some signings, so I'm enjoying it while it lasts. I still think Moyes isn't the right man for the job though - I can't see United ever retaining their place as best team in the league under him.

&gt;Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?

I would be happy with a Champions' League spot, preferably third though so we go straight into the group stages.

&gt;Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.

I *want* to believe that Suarez will stay, but I feel like fourth won't be good enough for him. He's one of the best players in the world, and playing for the fourth best club in the country wouldn't be good enough for him. I reckon a club like Madrid will be after him, and unless we do something amazing like win the league, then he'll be determined to leave again.

I'd like to sign a full back, a defensive midfielder, a wide forward, and depending on whether Agger or Skrtel is moved on, another centre back.

&gt;Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?

Evra. [Celebrating in front of Suarez in an attempt to provoke him](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqIjFDB0vcE) and [making fun of the biting incident](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbWIssaFbxo) make him come across as a giant twat, to be honest, regardless of whether Suarez was actually racist or not.

&gt;Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?

If we can do good business in the summer then we can be genuine title contenders (we still have an outside chance this season, with Chelsea and City still to come to Anfield). Rodgers has done a fantastic job - taking us from a team that people laughed at for how much we've regressed, to a team that has pundits and fans praising for how good they're doing makes him, in my opinion, a serious contender for manager of the season.

&gt;Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?

The 1-4 game in 2008/09. It was just an amazing display. Even Dossena scored!

&gt;Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?

United 1 (Rooney 42') - Liverpool 3 (Sturridge 18', 66', Gerrard 64' (pen))

&gt;Question 8 Where do you think both clubs will finish in the league this season.

The answer, is yes, ... because you can’t predict who’s going to come up with a brilliant idea, with a startling innovation.

Is this guy seriously suggesting that an immigrant street cleaner or till operator has a chance at curing a pandemic disease, or solving the energy crisis? 

By this logic, everyone should have as many children as possible and we should give visas out to everyone, because theres a chance that guy cleaning windows might crack nuclear fusion and save the whole economy and make us all rich.

true,smaclver,null,null,"**Question 1 Lets get it out of the way, what are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season who has moved from your local rivals to your biggest rivals in football?**

I assume you mean on United this season, rather than just what I think of you in general (which should go without saying). 

I never thought Moyes would fit for United, I was astonished by the nature of his appointment - it was one thing to let Ferguson nominate his replacement but to not even consider other candidates was remarkable to me. 

That said, I didn't expect United to dip so far, so quickly. I expected a 4 way battle for 3rd and 4th between us, Arsenal, yous and Spurs. 

At first Moyes' United went how I expected it to. Squad management and fitness policies were always going to be a problem, and the botched transfer window added to that. That said, I thought Moyes' would have found it easier to transmit his ideas to a squad as good as United's. Post Ronaldo leaving, United hadn't played too much great football and were actually quite functional and very effective. Which I thought would work to Moyes' advantage with fans and players alike. 

I'm rambling a bit so I'll try to speed up. Things started to go down hill when WBA got a result at Old Trafford and the fear factor had gone. United didn't start playing any worse after this, but a combination of not playing high enough up the pitch at home lead to teams being able to score and sit back vs. United (which under Ferguson would mean conceding too much possession and territory, but not vs. Moyes). 

Moyes hasn't really been able to fix this problem with the home form all season. And from there the problems have grown, frankly I think he's lost (possibly the majoirty of) the dressing room. He's certainly lost (or never really had) Evra, Ferdinand, Vidic, Van Persie and Nani (there's a reason an 18 year old kid has been his star performer for much of the season - one of the few not to have been picked by Ferguson). Because of this, no one at United is working hard either in transition or to support players on the ball (the Olympiakos game being the epitomy of this), and results won't improve without that happening.

I found it mad that you'd spend all that money on Mata, which seemingly just makes it harder for Januzaj to be in the team. Not the sort of personnel United need for Moyes to succeed, imo.


**Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?**
At this point I'd like to see us finish a minimum of third. Although I'd be delighted with fourth - I don't want a qualifier. I think we have a great opportunity to win the league although I make Chelsea strong favourites with their run in - I'd expect us to finish no more than 4 points from top spot.

**Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.**

Difficult question. No one can really know for sure. If we didn't get 4th, he'd obviously go, but we're going to get 4th so that doesn't matter. Whatever happens, we'll certainly get good money for him and I can make my peace with that. The new contract and qualifying for CL gives me hope that he'll stay but who really knows with him.

As for who we'll sign. No idea about names, but since the Aug 2012 window (afterwhich we reformed our transfer dept.) I've been fairly confident that the players we sign are at least not risky (ie £7m or Iago Aspas is a much kinder flop than £35m for Andy Carroll), so I wouldn't expect us to blow big money on crap players. I think Rodgers will want 1-2 full backs, a first choice right sided centre half, an all rounded midfielder, Konoplyanka (quick winger - sort of the equivalent of Ferguson signing Andrei Kanchelskis in 92) and keep Borini/Suso/Ilori when they return from their loans. Maybe a 4th striker if we sell Aspas.

No one here will be able to accurately guess names but knowing the sort of players we'd look for, I wouldn't be surprised if we signed Hugo Mallo, Ben Davies, Joel Matip, Will Hughes and Konoplyanka. 

Our outgoings I'd expect: Skrtel/Agger (one or both), Enrique/Johnson (one of them now, one next summer), Reina, Assaidi, Aspas, maybe Martin Kelly too I don't see where opportunities will come from.

**Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?**

Ferdinand, Giggs and Evra. One of them in particular for his unwarranted reputation as one of the gentleman of the game. I basically think they're bad people and have done for ages (the hatred for Evra predated the Suarez affair by the way - he was in the right on this one). 

**Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?**

It's not just capitalising on United's weakness, we've leapfrogged Spurs, the Ev and Arsenal too. No one in Europe has improved as much as we have (not even Roma). We have the same amount of points from 28 games as City did last season. 

But that's not why I'm confident it's not a one season thing. Rodgers has fundamentally improved every player he has worked with here. Right down from Ste Gerrard and Luis Suarez (who scored 0.4 goals per game rather than 1.2 when Rodgers got here), to the likes of Aly Cissokho and Flanagan. In this respect he's quite similar to Ferguson - he raises everbody's game through his man management and coaching and gets the best out of his individual coaches (which separates him stylistically from the likes of Rafa/Houllier who were more focused on every member of the team being a tactical cog in the machine - where the system won the games rather than the players). 

If you divide Rodgers reign into 5 game buckets, right from the very start Liverpool improve in every one in just about every metric - goals, shots on targets, points and just looking at the nature of the performance. The turnaround under Rodgers hasn't just been lightning fast but remarkably consistent. Ferguson's retirement gave us a chance to rejoin the elite but Rodgers has done everything possible to take that chance and deserves an enormous amount of praise.


**Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?**

The 4-1. Is there any explanation needed? Great memories of the Murphy winners too though. Fuck it every time we beat you is great. Particularly when we do you 6-0 on Sunday.

**Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday**

Liverpool at least 2 up by half time and win by at least 4. 

**Question 8 Where do you think both clubs will finish in the league this season.**

Liverpool 1st-3rd.

The problem is less that politicians are not giving funding to other cities but more that politicians have not done enough (I'm not entirely sure what they would do) to stimulate growth (economic and population) in other cities so that they can seriously claim to need the funding London takes. Politicians aren't seriously going to turn down a huge project like cross rail which is needed to take stress off the already overcrowded commuter lines into London in favour of another project in another city where it's less crowded and the population is growing at a slower rate so future need is also less. If Manchester had the same stupidly packed trains as London then it would attract funding for new infrastructure but it doesn't perhaps because not enough is being done to help growth - the whole problem is not going to be solved by throwing money where it's not needed.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt; Sure he has made a few mistakes, every keeper has

You probably haven't watched Cech too often over the years then. I have never seen him make as many mistakes in one season has he has in this season and I've watched him every season since he joined us. Also, his best season since the head injury was 2 years ago during the CL winning year. Not because we won the CL, but because Cech was as close to flawless as possible throughout that season. Watch the games in CL especially. It was a shame that Casillas was still recognized as the best keeper in the world in that season, because Cech was way way better.

&gt; And lastly, I've said it before, but, I am still waiting for the source of the ""Cech wanting to retire early"" shit.

&gt; I have been very surprised by Terry, Cahills emergence and his partnership with Terry has extended Terrys career.

Goes to show how much you know about our players. Only reason JT was considered as done last season was because 1. he was struggling with an injury, and 2. because Benitez was a huge dbag. He systematically zoned Terry out of the team, just like he did with Demba Ba because he wanted Torres to be the team's number 1 striker and get back to scoring - although with the Torres bit I'm sure Roman had at least a little bit to do with it. Bottom line, JT still has a good 1-2 years more in him at the very least.

Also, your claim about Cahill influencing Terry's return is completely laughable. If anything, Cahill is where he is today, this season, only because of Terry. Even this season when Terry has not played and with Cahill at the back we've looked a mess defensively. Terry's organization of the defensive structure is unparalleled in the Premiership.

&gt; Luke Shaw: I just do not see it anymore. Perhaps last summer, but now, there is very little reason to sign him. He is going to cost too much and for what?

If anything, signing Luke Shaw is more realistic than ever. We made a move to sign him last summer as well (remember Mourinho claiming we tried to sign an English player) and failed because his price was too high for us to pay *during that summer.* We've made a very good profit on the players we've sold so far, as well as last season's revenue including the increasing sponsorship money from Samsung + Adidas which will kick in this summer PLUS the money from other sponsors and the money from players that will be sold means we will have enough cash to facilitate moves for the players we wish to purchase.",0,1394555286,null,0,false,0,cfzwqbj,t3_202uzq,t1_cfzwqbj,t1_cfzc7b9,null,1432753643,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

true,rough_outline,lfc68,,"Question 1 Lets get it out of the way, what are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season who has moved from your local rivals to your biggest rivals in football?

I don't like Utd, simple as that really, you won't see me frothing at the mouth though.

Moyes is simply not good enough to be managing a club of Utd's size. His appointment was a massive surprise, a silly joke that turned out to be real. You could see at Everton, he couldn't handle pressure well at all, you could see mentally he didn't have it in him to be a top manager, everything else is irrelevant when someone buckles under pressure like that.

Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?

At the beginning of the season, top four but now, I'd like to see us get top two, maybe even first.

Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.

I don't know, I don't think he'll try to force a move like he did last summer but if Real Madrid comes in for like he did with Ronaldo (though they usually start tapping up a year prior to their actual move), then I could see him going, but not really worried, I personally think he'll stay next season.

As for signings, I'd like a left back, right sided centre back and a goal scoring forward.

Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?

I don't like Rooney or Evra, but considering how one is shafting you worse than the glazers and the other is shit and will jump ship in the summer, I'm starting to warm to them.

Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?

Rodgers is a top manager, very progressive and adaptable, he's getting the best out of players. It's internal factors that have caused us to improve so much.

Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?

In recent years, has to be the 4-1, there were more people on the pitch than in the stands by the final whistle. Loyalty eh?

Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?

We'll win.

Van Persie is just a total dork in my opinion, never liked a player like him that that changes from [relatively big] teams just to chase trophies.  Like why not win it at a team like Arsenal that had stuck by you through so much who could conceivably win?

2.  Realistically third or fourth.  Title?  If we go crazy.

3.  I think he will stay.  No doubt in my mind really.  I would like to see Konoplyanka; he looks pretty cool and fast and fun and pacey and quick and tricky and stuff.

4.  I hate Patrice Evra.  I think he is a showy dork, but also I think he manipulated that whole racism scandal in a very negative way.  I don't think the situation indicated any racist intent and Evra saying it did was complete farce and an awful show of character.  And then it was clear that Evra was the one who made the handshake a thing; he put his hand down.  

5.  I don't think Rodgers this season has had to capitalize on United's weaknesses.  We won 1-0 in a hard fought game; this next game might be a different story.  I do think he is turning the club around in the most positive way imaginable.

6. I really like the 2011 victory a few March's ago.  Dirk Kuyt's hat trick was really overshadowed by Suarez being new and brilliant.

7.  I really hate predictions, because I never think we are going to lose any games ever.  That being said, I think we are going to win.

true,KlobbLoblaw,lfc68,,"**Question 1 What are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season?**

Schadenfreude the likes of which I have not experienced since Everton got into the Champions League and got knocked out in qualifying. Moyes isn't a terrible manager, but he was a terrible choice for one of the biggest teams in world football. His brand of negative football can only get you so far. I was delighted to hear Ferguson publicly calling for everyone to give him time. 


**Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?**

Beating Southampton was the first time I found myself going, ""Oh god... I'm starting to believe now"". We'll likely finish 3rd or 4th, which we'll all be elated with, but winning it is not completely bonkers. And even that on its own is a remarkable turnaround from 2 years ago.

**Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign?**

Providing we don't capitulate and miss out on the Champions League, I think he'll stay. He's nuts and exciting, our football is nuts and exciting; it's a match made in heaven.

**Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?**

I don't feel threatened enough by United to hate them any more. That said, RVP is pretty easy to dislike. A horrible shithouse. He doesn't have a reputation for being ""that kind of player"", but he should do, which I think makes him even more annoying. I also imagine he has had the exact same haircut since he was 11 years old.


**Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?**

Well, it's March and we're 2nd. If that doesn't count as ""genuine title contenders"", when we've been there or there abouts all season, I don't know what does. He's been absolutely brilliant. I'm particularly impressed by how much he's learned from his mistakes and is willing to try new solutions. And I've never seen Liverpool play such exciting football in my lifetime. We're not the best team in the league, but fuck me we're fun to watch!


**Question 6 Which is your favourite game against us, and why?**
1-4 is the obvious answer - a glorious day to be a Liverpool fan. Just to add a bit of variety, though, the 3-3 at Anfield in 1993 (?) stands out, as does the 2-0 victory in the 2000/01 season (Stevie screamer past Barthez + tidy Fowler finish). Oh, and the two goals Fowler scored at Old Trafford in Cantona's comeback game. Good times.


**Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?**

We'll DEFINITELY concede, but I fancy us to be able to score more goals than you. 3-1 us.

It's been hilarious, bordering on slapstick, and I'm loving every minute of it.

**Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?**

I think we'll edge Arsenal and come in 3rd. Anything below 4th would be a massive disappointment at this point. I'd also love to see United get Europa league. Rooney on a wet pitch somewhere in Belarus on a Thursday night.. Like I said, hilarious.

**Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.**

Suarez will probably stay (70-30), he's getting CL, and he seems a quite conventional, family oriented lad. I think he's settled, and won't look to move unless Real come for him. If they do, he's gone (but I don't think they will).

**Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?**

Evra due to the whole Suarez-thing, and his conduct on the French national team. Seems a self-righteous cunt.


**Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?**

No, you guys are managing to suck all on your own, just as we've taken a couple of huge steps up regardless of United. There are other teams in the league, you know. Arsenal finally spent money, Tottenham spent a bunch and Everton has been brilliant, yet we've thrashed them all.

**Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?**

4-1 at Old Trafford 2008-09, because we thoroughly deserved it, we were better than you at the time by a distance (beat Real Madrid 4-0 the same week). Just Rafa kept losing points against the likes of Wigan, Stoke (twice!) and Arshavin had his one good game. Genuinely feel we deserved the title that year, but at least we gave you a hiding in Manchester.

**Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?**

Impossible to tell. Both teams always mobilise for the derby, so it could always go any which way. But lord help you if we get an early goal.

**Question 8 Where do you think both clubs will finish in the league this season.**

Liverpool 3 or 4, Man Utd 5th, I think both Everton and Tottenham have lost the plot a bit. You guys are done with the worst for this season, but it will be difficult to rebuild. I predict that during the coming years, you have to get used to being just another club among many.

Now, it is true Ballack was the ""de facto"" captain, as you just don't willy-nilly swap the arm band when you have had a consentant player like Ballack with it, but Lowe always favored Lahm and Schweinsteiger, and in the end went with Lahm. 

The rift was between Lowe and Ballack, and the only players Ballack didn't get on with was really only Podolski (see Wales game.)

true,__shadow,lfc50,,"&gt;Question 1 Lets get it out of the way, what are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season who has moved from your local rivals to your biggest rivals in football?

I rate Moyes. Give him time and he will get results. It wont necessarily be the most attractive sort of football every time, but I think he has what it takes to deliver. He needs time.

&gt;Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?

Realistically third or fourth.

&gt;Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.

I think he will stay as we will most likely get into CL next year. I would love it if we can sign Luke Shaw and Konoplyanka.

&gt;Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?

I don't really hate any Man United players really. But I really dislike Evra.
 
&gt;Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?

I think BR has been turning the tide since Jan 2013, irrespective of whats happening at United. Am sure he can bring back the glory years to Liverpool, given enough time and money. Look at what he's done in the past 15 months.

&gt;Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?

As many others have said it here, 1-4 at OT in 09.

&gt;Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?

Realistically, I see us winning 1-2.

true,Gaz133,null,null,"1. I think Moyes has had trouble getting Man United to adjust to his style. For the longest time United under Ferguson were an attacking team but Moyes doesn't really play that way. He's always been more of a reactive manager so his philosophy doesn't necessarily jive with what United have been doing for the last 25 years and you're seeing it in the disjointed performances. Many United players look unsure of what they're supposed to do so they end up playing slow and all you end up getting are crosses into the box which is not what you'd expect from Manchester United. Given time maybe he can mold the team into more of his ideas, but I am skeptical that the United fans will stand for that sort of football.

2. Anything short of top 4 at this point would be a disaster. I don't expect to win the title but it's pretty fun to see how close we can get given that we have literally nothing to lose.

3. 100% he will stay so long as we remain top 4. He signed a huge new contract and can you think of a team outside Bayern Munich that is playing better football than we have at times this year? Why would he leave this situation? Not sure exactly who to target but obviously fullback is the weakest position for us so I'd expect 1 or 2 signed this summer.

4. Meh...

5. I don't understand this question. Capitalizing on United's weakness? I mean, if you're saying that we're only top 4 because United shit the bed this year that's hardly accurate given that we're currently in 2nd and 11 points clear of United. Did United win the title last year just because City and Chelsea were weak? Rodgers has done a fantastic job one at managing the squad and second at setting the team up tactically in the best way possible for each game. He knows what his strengths are and he's played to them rather than forcing his team to adapt to his own rigid philosophy. I don't know how much more Liverpool have to do to get you to not ask whether we're ""genuine title contenders"" or not... That's a silly question. I don't think the squad is as deep as Chelsea/City/Arsenal but we don't have any other games beyond the PL and if we keep scoring 3-4 every game then we're gonna get damn close to the title one way or another.

6. 4-1 Old Trafford for obvious reasons and the Suarez/Kuyt hat trick game in 2011 if only because that was the first game when we realized how special Suarez really was.

7. I think United will have a go at it... There have been games this year on the road where we struggle to score and we know we're vulnerable at the back so it's not a slam dunk I don't think. I think Liverpool win, but it will be tough. Maybe 2-1.

It would help people be more politically aware especially when reading the news and trying understand world events. The flag waving and anthem singing can die and unpleasant death as far as I am concerned but certainly one part of American patriotism I'm envious of is how rightfully proud they are of their political tradition of liberties and human rights. Their government seems much less enthusiastic about the whole thing but at least Americans can point to constitution and say 'These are my rights and that's how I know your violating them'. 

If we had a more proud attitude to our own liberal traditions (most of which informed the American constitution) I think we would be more likely to assert our rights, use our rights and we'd all be more politically engaged. Plus when it comes to actually articulating why we are opposed to extremism and Islamic fundamentalism it would benefit us hugely if we could actually point to a document or a series of laws which define our value system as a country and why extremism if pretty much any kind violates those principles and thus why we won't tolerate it in this country.

true,cypherspaceagain,lfc93,,"Question 1 Lets get it out of the way, what are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season who has moved from your local rivals to your biggest rivals in football?

I'm a football fan first and foremost - I love watching football. I have, in previous years, while hating Utd as a Liverpool fan, thought that they were a formidable team with a lying, hypocritical prick who massively pressured referees to give him as a result as a manager. This year, they are complete rubbish. Although I love football and don't usually enjoy watching rubbish games, I can't deny that I love the fact you're so crap this season. I don't think it's Moyes's fault entirely, Fergie left him with bare bones and Cleverley. You were sold the title last season by Arsenal. I don't dislike Moyes, but I don't think he's doing a particularly good job at all. I think others could do better. Then again, they wouldn't do the same job that he might be able to with young players.

Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?
Top four, 3rd is most likely but I genuinely think we can win the title with lucky results. We have to play Chelsea and City at home. Win those games and we can win the title.

Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.
Yes if we get CL, so yes. No idea, but I trust Brendan's judgement most of the time. A half-decent centre-back might be good.

Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?
Rooney. I think he's an arrogant, blustery waste of space a lot of the time, the epitome of the stupid English footballer who thinks shouting will get you somewhere.

Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?
The latter. Give him time and money and he will build a team capable of competing with anyone.

Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?
4-1 at Old Trafford. Just one of the greatest games ever in the middle of one of the best weeks of football we've ever played. 4-1 against you, 4-0 against Madrid with the best opening 15 minutes I've seen until Arsenal this year, then 5-0 against Villa. A set of just brilliant results coming one after another. The most optimistic I've been as a Liverpool fan until this year.

Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?
We'll beat you.

true,Death_proofer,null,null,"**Question 1 Lets get it out of the way, what are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season who has moved from your local rivals to your biggest rivals in football?**

I think Moyes is a great manager but honestly 90% of the managers that would have to had to follow Fergie would probably be going through the same thing. But for our benefit ofI hope he stays and keeps doing what he's doing. 

**Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?**

A lot of people are saying we can win the title, I'm not convinced. But if we can get a result at old trafford I'll edge more towards a 2nd place finish.

**Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.**

Yes Suarez will stay unless Real Madrid offer something like 80 million for him. I would like to see Liverpool sign a Puyolesq defender. A rock that organises and has a tremendous presence. What player that may be, I'm not sure.

**Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?**

Van Persie I find to be a smug asshole. The manner in which he left Arsenal I thought was in bad taste. But I also never liked Vidic much either. Van der sar I also couldn't stand.

**Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?**

He is turning the club around. The style we're playing is amazing and the fact that we have 70 odd goals so far has nothing to do with how badly united are playing. Rodgers is the man.

**Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?**

4-1 at old trafford a few years ago. Torres equalised and Aurelio scored an amazing free kick.

**Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?**

You lot are a bit weak, but I still see it being a hard game for us. I think we'll just cross the line first.

**Question 8 Where do you think both clubs will finish in the league this season.**

Secondly the primary aim is to connect the other cities with *London* and not improve journey times between these cities.  So in order to go from Leeds to Manchester on the HS2 you would need to travel on the Leeds to London route, get off at Birmingham and change onto the London to Manchester.  The only non-London journeys to benefit will be Manchester-Birmingham and Leeds-Birmingham.

The Leeds-Birmingham route is phase 2 and I think there will be a real risk that phase 1 (Manchester-London) will be so expensive and the returns so unimpressive that phase 2 never happens.

I think you'll struggle to find a genuine ticket for $80 through touts - £80 would probably be more reasonable. Typically I'd say you're shit out of luck trying to get a ticket this close to a home game for any sensible figure, but the Sunderland game is rescheduled from the original date and also a mid-week evening fixture so there's probably less demand than usual and a few more spares knocking about. Other than through the club there's no real way to know if you're being offered genuine tickets or not though, so it's your risk.

I'd also point out that you have zero chance of getting back to London after the game in the evening.

true,AmericanSteve,null,null,"**Question 1 Lets get it out of the way, what are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season who has moved from your local rivals to your biggest rivals in football?**

I am an American so I don't have the visceral hatred of Liverpool that over fans have. I mean I want to beat you 5-0 every time but I am not hoping for the Gillettes to get cancer. I think Moyes is performing as expected. He inherited a team that was in freefall and is doing the best possible job of it. I do think that he won't improve the team much. His skill is at finding mid-table players and getting them to play at the top of the mid=table list.


**Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?**

Reasonably, I think third. The league is still within the realm of possibility but anything fourth or higher is fine with me.


**Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.**

I think he will stay, assuming CL.

**Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?**

Evra is a massive prick.


**Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?**

I think Rodgers' season is unrelated to United's weakness. He is having a great season with young players (and lots of injuries) but I think it will take a lot of money from FSG to turn them into genuine title contenders. 

**Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?**

Any game between ManU and LFC is a great one. Better when LFC win.


**Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?**

I think it will end 1-1 or LFC will blow it open early and it will end 3-1.

Well great. But when there are only 3 trains an hour and the service stops at 10pm, it's useless. The tube runs at up to 20 trains an hour at peak times. You don't need to worry about train times.

true,inquisitivinatorer,lfc99,,"I know I'm probably too late but I thought I would give my answers, if for nothing else to just waste 5 minutes. 

Question 1 As a rival I am quite enjoying what is happening at Utd this season especially after what we have had to go through, especially the last few years with the Hodgson era (shudders). As a football fan, I think it is quite sad what is happening at Utd and think it's quite bad for the league if such a big team is doing so badly for an extended period of time. As far as Moyes goes, I don't think he is good enough for Utd and I think for the better of the team and for the league to be more competitive he needs to go. Even if he gets a big transfer budget in the Summer it doesn't instantly mean his tactics will get better. I think the Summer is the perfect time for Utd to get a new manager as they will be able to use the supposed big transfer budget to make the team a lot better as well as being able to get rid of a lot of players that don't want to be or shouldn't be there. Personally though, I don't think Utd will sack Moyes simply because I don't think it is something they will want to do after just one season, and who knows, maybe Moyes will get better? But I personally doubt it.  

Question 2 I think if you ask any reasonable LFC fan they will say we our aim is still top 4, anything above that is a bonus. Top 4 is ours to lose though so unless something bad happens that shouldn't be a problem. I think we will end up 3rd come the end of the season with Arsenal in 4th, basing this on just recent form. 

Question 3 I think we can keep Suarez in the Summer as long as we can show some real intent for the title for the rest of the season as well as signing some good players. Without those two, I think he will leave, but we won't be too bothered as long as we get the right amount of money for him and use that wisely. As for signings, I don't have anyone in-particular, I just want players that can come in right away and improve the first team.  

Question 4 Current is probably Rooney for quite a few reason, not least his wasted ability by the restrictions he puts on himself. Overall, Gary Neville. Although he has won me over ever so slightly now that he is a pundit. Him and Carra together are a joy to watch and they are both very insightful.

Question 5 Rodgers is having a very good season, but I don't think it is a one season thing although he will have to prove that next season. Since he signed for us he has been improving us all the time and has us playing great football, he just needs to sort out the defence. But he is of course helped by the fact that Utd are having such a dreadful season. I think it is clear that right now we are genuine title contenders, we won't win it this season, but as long as we are in the race I am happy. 

Question 6 The 4-1. Simply because we played so well and made your lot look bad. 

Question 7 I feel we will win just because we are obviously better than you this season, but I don't think it will be as easy as a lot of people are making out. Even when we were having a bad time of it in previous seasons we have managed to win or at least step our game up against you. In these types of games form goes out of the window and players are usually more pumped up for these games.

true,munkywrench,null,null,"A fourth runway at Heathrow would reduce the number of flights in the South East significantly, according to confidential analysis that has been described as a “game-changer” by opponents of the airport’s expansion.

In a private submission to the Airports Commission, Nats, the air traffic control service, calculated “conflicting arrival and departure flows” and concluded that building a fourth runway in West London would reduce the combined capacity of Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Luton, Birmingham, City and Southend airports by 9 per cent.

It would cut capacity relative to a three-runway Heathrow by 18 per cent because of the disruption to flight paths to the other main airports.

Those against Heathrow expansion said that the analysis, seen by The Times, was a “game-changer” in the debate over airport expansion as it undermined the long-term case for doubling the size of the country’s biggest airport.

Opponents, including Boris Johnson and local residents’ groups, claim that a third runway would be a “Trojan Horse” opening the way for another and subjecting more than a million people to unacceptable noise pollution.

The government-backed commission that will decide where to build the next runway has put on its shortlist two possible configurations for a third runway at Heathrow and a second runway at Gatwick. Sir Howard Davies, head of the commission, said that a third runway could be built by 2030 but that it would be full by 2050.

The commission has excluded a four-runway Heathrow from its shortlist, but the airport’s £31 billion blueprint for expansion includes options to build two new runways. In its submission, Heathrow said that a third runway would meet the demand for air travel to 2040 but that from 2030 a decision would have to be taken on a fourth.

Mr Johnson said: “A third runway at Heathrow would be followed by a fourth as surely as night follows day, and if our air traffic experts believe that will result in less overall aviation capacity rather than more, then that is yet another starkly obvious reason why expansion at Heathrow is a total no-go.”

The Nats report, submitted to the commission last November, concluded that construction of a fourth runway would cut the maximum possible number of flights into the main airports frokm 1,680,000 to 1,550,000.
Flights at Gatwick, Stansted and Luton would be reduced by 50 per cent. London City would see a 25 per cent reduction.

John Stewart, chairman of the campaign group Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise, said: “The fear locally must be that if demand does increase, a third runway will effectively become a Trojan Horse for a fourth runway. That is genuinely a new fact which could be a game-changer.”

The Nats analysis highlights the difficulties of turning Heathrow into a “megahub” airport, but also points to potential limitations of a new hub in the Thames Estuary.

It could increase total airport capacity by just 6 per cent, because of the closure of Heathrow, City and Southend airports. However, if runways were tilted to run northeast-southwest, the airport would increase total capacity by 24 per cent.

Supporters of the scheme say that Nats has underestimated the potential benefits because it assumes that a new hub would face the same constraints as Heathrow, operating between 6am and 11pm. Because far fewer people would be affected by noise, it could operate 24 hours a day, resulting in a far greater capacity increase, they argue.

Sir Howard will make his final recommendation three months after the 2015 election.

I miss the Ferguson era. I feel like our rise in quality this season is somewhat lost in Moyes' plummeting United. I would have liked to see a Liverpool side topple Ferguson's United.
  
---

&gt; Q2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?  

I think 3rd or 4th. We could go higher but I'm cautious that although we've been awesome, we've been helped by other teams faltering.

---

&gt; Q3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.  

I believe so for another season. I would hope beyond that but I also think switching last season could have been a risk for him with WC coming up. Not with regards to getting in the squad, but switching locations, teams etc could harm form.

---

&gt; Q4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?  

Evra but this is a tough one. Suarez probably deserved what he got punishment-wise and he may have done what Evra alleged, but I think press reaction to any controversy is overkill and don't think he deserves to be branded a racist for being an idiot in a match. It's an irrational dislike I'll admit!

---

&gt; Q5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?  

They're not related. We've played United once in the league this year. That's 3 points out of 59. I'm not sure he's turning us into title contenders, but I am enjoying the football we're playing more than I ever have. We are the entertainers of the league, both in attack and our often-calamitous defence. There is never a dull game as an LFC supporter now, and I don't think that's a trait of champions, but I honestly don't care.

As with everyone else, the 4-1.

We should win it, but it's a derby and I just can't help but be worried we'll lose.

I'd personally like us to sign Yann M'Vila, Konoplyanka, or Romain Allessandrini, and less realistically Shaw is the dream.

5. If by ""capitalizing on your weaknesses"" you mean ""doing better than you"", then he's obviously done both of your options. We are genuine title contenders, but we're the least likely of the four, possibly one spot higher than Arsenal.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt; Crime has existed ever since human societies existed.

got any evidence for this? Anthropologists would most certainly disagree. If we assume you are correct why did it take until the 1830s in Britain to get a police force if crime had been so endemic since the beginning of human civilisation. Most crime today in Britain is drug related, to get that crime you have to criminalise drugs, for most of human history nature wasn’t made illegal and people were allowed to take what drugs they wanted (of course the drugs you’re allowed to take today have to be made by big corporations, they’d never make those illegal).

&gt;If you actually think that the police make crime worse, perhaps you might want to consider spending time somewhere with no police force, and see how you get on? Certain parts of Mexico might be appealing to you.

This just shows how stupid you are. The police in Mexico are one of the most dangerous in the world, they regularly kidnap tourists and give them as offering to drug lords who sell them into prostitution or use their organs. So much so that several areas and communities in Mexico have abolish the police force, and pushed it out of their town. It's been a lot safer since, [see here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XiSnCt9fDc). They’ve done what's needed, they made their community safe by creating community self-defence units, not composed of detached professionals with rights and freedoms above the rest like the police, but a voluntary collective always answerable and recallable to the community it serves. 

I suggest you actually do some research or read a book before making such outlandish and self-evidently false statements, it just makes you look stupid.

The Unions and Thatcher had been building up for the Strikes in 1984 for almost 4-5 years. Unions as much as they maybe where supported by the mining communities were radical and wanted to flex their power to Thatcher.

Really the miners lost in the end not because Thatcher was more powerful but because there own radicalism, made them forget about democracy. No vote to strike meant Nottinghamshire Stayed open and the lights stayed on. 

The Unions killed there own power, and Thatcher won. I don't agree everything she did was good, but she knew which was the right way to go, Unions didn't.

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"Problem : Housing shortage

Solution : Build more houses

Every other problem has a root in the housing shortage. If there were a sufficient number of new houses being built people would turn their noses up at ridiculously undersized rooms.

That said it would help if we had regulations over what could be described as a bedroom. However it won't solve anything in itself.

Laws to penalise empty dwellings won't help much either, they'll cause a one time reduction in the average number of empty dwellings, and a small one off increase to the housing supply but nothing afterwards. The burden of the legislation will carry on afterwards.

Sadly the governments help to buy scheme makes things worse rather than better. It supports demand. The problem isn't that people can't afford houses - think about it. What would happen if we could all easily afford houses? We'd all pay more and instantly house prices would rise to the point where we couldn't all afford houses. It's a game of musical chairs and if we all get faster there's no more chairs to go around. 

There's two main ways houses can enter the market. Either the government works out why house builders are so bad at building houses - are there any real barriers? I have to admit my knowledges doesn't stretch to an in-depth understanding of the house building market. 

The other is that the government mandate local government to build social housing which will revolve into private ownership over time.

If the housing supply problem is solved, everything else is solved.",0,1394561476,null,0,false,0,cfzzm2c,t3_205gjm,t1_cfzzm2c,t3_205gjm,null,1432755001,41,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,41

One of the best starting points is Peter Taylor's excellent three part series on each major group
[Brits: the war against the IRA](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Brits-War-Against-Peter-Taylor/dp/074755806X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394562660&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=brits+the+war+against+the+ira) looks at the role of the British government and Army during the Troubles, especially the role of 14 intelligence company.
[Provos: The IRA and Sin Fein](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Provos-IRA-Sinn-Fein/dp/0747538182/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y) looks at the Republican (those natives who wanted a united Ireland through violent means) side of the conflict while
[Loyalists](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Loyalists-Peter-Taylor/dp/0747545197/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_y) looks at a much less explored topic of the loyalist (natives who identified themselves as British) side of the conflict. They are all relatively neutral in their stance and are excellently researched with a touch of humanism yet balanced by a strong journalistic style which makes for compelling yet enlightening reading


Each book was accompanied by a television series which can be found on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/26and6equals1/videos), although it is a little fragmented.

5 I think you're out of the picture, I would consider Southampton to be your main competition for that last Europa League spot which if you're lucky you'll miss out on.

I absolutely love the work Moyes is doing. Hope United stick with him for another season.
&gt;Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?

5th before season started, 4th after New Years and Top 3 now.

&gt;Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.

If we qualify to CL then yes he will stay. I'd like the club to sign a DM and LB. We've been linked with Parejo which is encouraging. 

&gt;Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?

Probably Rooney. I do not understand why but I hate him with a passion. I'm going to say due to playing for Everton before United.
&gt;Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?

United and Spurs underachieving has been a major boast, but Rodgers has been slowly adjusting and adapting the team to turn Liverpool into a real force once more. We've seen it this year with how he abandoned his 'Death by football' philosophy, which required playing a possession game and instead his focus on finding the right system for the players available. He's also not shy to change formations, in order to get a result. 

&gt;Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?

The 4-1 game at Old Trafford. You don't score four goals at United every day. So that was special

&gt;Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?

I'm going with a tight 3-2 game for us.

Henderson because the amount of shit he's had to deal with over the transfer price and he refused to move on and instead stayed and worked his arse off.

Gerrard because I was expecting him to seriously start showing his age but the deeper role has really suited him and he's hardly missed a game.

Flanagan, had a horrid time and was given up on by a lot of us. Came back strong and has looked brilliantly determined in every game, he might not be the most amazing player but he doesn't half do his best.

Sterling in fourth mostly because he was already a very highly rated player and had already shown what he was capable of. He's still come on a massive amount though, his defensive work has improved, his ability in the final third and he's even found the net a few times.

Let's review what happened with the evening-

-They have 25 women speak on issues that are important to each of them (these aren't necessarily all about women/feminism- one was about fracking, for example)

-One of the 25 speakers is Cara Park, who performs [this speech](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/10/solidarity-women-cara-park-international-womens-day?CMP=twt_gu) to the audience, wearing a dress and large feather necklace. Under the necklace she is topless, but, for one thing, her breasts were not on display- they were hidden from view for the audience. For another, everyone is topless *under the clothes they're wearing.* (in this case, a necklance covered her breasts, in other cases, people might use bras) Her outfit is designed to highlight body-shaming of women in our society.

-The Belfast Telegraph report the evening- *but they only report on Cara*- and not only that, they do not talk about what she said, but rather, decided to become morally outraged that, thanks to a photographer sneaking *behind the podium she was speaking at,* there was a picture which showed that Cara, we now know, has at least one breast (**shock horror**).

Cara Park was not aiming to ""raise her profile and damage everyone else,"" as you asserted- she was one of many women taking part in a celebration of femininity and solidarity with the oppressed. It was no stunt on her part, past her outfit being a *small part* of her performance.

The Belfast Telegraph were the ones who reported only on Cara's breasts, and not about anything of real substance (not to insult Cara's breasts, but they're not what her talk was about). It would be foolish to believe that, had Cara not been wearing what she was, the BelTel would comprehensively detail the evening and its speeches- they did this for cheap journalism, and they are the ones who've undermined the evening, not (which is what got me angry) Cara Park, as you blame her.

It just so happens that the Belfast Telegraph have proved feminism's point somewhat; that no matter what was said, and how much intelligent thought was displayed, they would only aim to use women for cheap sex appeal and outrage.

So, please, don't blame Cara: Blame the Telegraph for this most lazy journalism.

Casting my mind back to Sunday last week; the sun was shining and life was good. I gave the bike a good clean (it was caked in a thick layer of grime that had accumulated over the last few weeks/months) and headed out for a well deserved blast around my local haunts.

Not surprisingly the roads were *packed* with motorcycles, many of which had obviously been kept in a garage over the colder months. You could spot the riders who hadn't been riding for a while because they were wobbling all over the place. Eventually after about 40 minutes of riding I pulled over to stretch my legs. A couple of riders I had passed earlier (a Fireblade and a ZX-10) pulled up not long afterwards and we got chatting about bikes. It soon became apparent that for them, bikes were nothing but cool-toys that made them look 'cool' rather than a means to get about or a skill that needs to be honed and developed. They flat-out refused to believe that anyone could commute on a motorcycle, let alone during the winter months.

true,Dugalu,null,null,"&gt;Question 1 Lets get it out of the way, what are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season who has moved from your local rivals to your biggest rivals in football?

* I think the man definitely has a Wenger-esque eye for transfers but I am not entirely convinced this will translate to buying world class players as this is definitely a new experience for Moyes.  He seems to be running a similar system to at Everton which I believe is a huge waste of the talent he has when he reduces them to 'lumping it forward' as they say.

&gt;Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?


* Realistaclly, 3rd-4th.  I think it depends more on Arsenal imploding or not imploding.  If they continue to have a poor run of form they will finish 4th and we will pip them for 3rd, but we still have a hugely tough run of games but thankfully they are at home where our record is nothing short of superb.  

&gt;Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.

* I actually think he will stay if we are in the champions league, for at least next season.  Madrid have Benzema as a striker (even though it is an entirely different mold then Suarez) but Suarez this season is involved very heavily in the build up play, which requires lots of room and players interchanging positions.  I do not see Ronaldo rolling over to play second fiddle to Suarez or even Bale for that matter.  I really just can't see him moving to Arsenal / Chelsea as those fans are a bit more fickle with players and would have given him the boot for all the shit he's done where we were between a rock and a hard place, get rid of our clearly best player and be stuck in mediocrity as a team for another year or longer or stick by his side and hope for the best, I suppose it worked out heavily in our favor in the end.

* I would like to see the club sign actual starters and not rotation players, once the squad is full of star performers then you can buy and bench the Salah type players.  I know this means players like Sterling will have to go back to the bench but ultimately I think it may be for the best.

&gt;Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?

* Outside of the pitch hatred - Rooney, just a fucking scum bag and I don't think even united fans can refute that.  Banging hookers while you wife is pregnant is not exactly a stellar move.   Rio for trying to be fucking fake Ashton Kutcher and 'punking people'.  I know British people dislike Americans more often than not but why do you choose to emulate the shittiest celebrities we have if we suck so much?

* On the pitch - RvP is pretty cuntish, maybe Fellaini because he was cunty at Everton during the derbies. 

&gt;Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?

* I think Rodgers when appointed was one of those precarious appointments, he was either going to step up a level or be humbled back to mid tables, judging by his character, interviews from players and staff and executives I believe it to be Rodgers growing and improving heavily as a coach.  I believe he is doing a fantastic job and next year we are going to be a big force in the premiership (fingers crossed for a big run in the UCL but I doubt we could win it).  I don't exactly think this is ""taking advantage of united's weakness"" as that rules out all other teams we are having to battle against for the top 4 this year, which would mean Spurs, Everton, Liverpool, City, Arsenal and Chelsea are all ""taking advantage of your weakness"" when really United's squad is frail at this point and is now paying the price for trusting that Rio Ferdinand was still up to the task of marking players like Lukaku, Sturridge, Hazard, Negredo, Aguero, which I do not think he is.


&gt;Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?

* The one from 5 years ago where Torres spanked Vidic after the Ronaldo penalty, ended 1-4 Liverpool win.  Not specifically because that is a huge result but mainly it was a memorable week, we also defeated Madrid 4-0 that week at Anfield, was a pretty great week.

&gt;Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?

* Honestly, our away record isn't great and you are coming off a 3-0 victory (over WBA but hey, wins a win) so I think it may be another boring 1-0 but I also think this has the potential to be a massively entertaining game.  United get to attempt to deny us a Champions league spot while desperately trying to get back among the top 4 where as we are pushing hard for 2nd or 3rd (or the insanely low odds of 1st but hey theres still a chance.)  Could shape out to be one of the crazy 4-3's or 3-2 games of the season.

true,panzerpelz,lfc12,,"1. I have always kind of respected Everton, they're a decent team, and Moyes did fairly well with them. Never had anything against Moyes, he even handled the legendary Suarez diving celebration fairly well. Seeing as Moyes has transformed Man Utd from a top team to a struggling team (at least temporarily)  works in his favour, so I can't bring myself to hating him just yet. 

2. I don’t think Liverpool will win. Chelsea are too strong. It is painful to be beaten by that horrible plastic team lead by Mourinho with his tiresome mind games, but what can you do? I hope we can give City a proper fight for 2nd, and I think 3rd is fairly realistic. I won't be terribly disappointed with 4th, but if we're caught by Tottenham I will cry bitter tears. They have been horribly boring this year and deserve nothing. 

3. I think Suarez will be looking for a way out no matter how high we finish this year, perhaps unless we finish 1st. He's trying to smooth things over, not burning any bridges, but he probably wants to play in Spain. He will probably stay for a season or two more though, since I don't think Madrid want him just yet.

4.  Ashley Young, he's the worst diver in the league. Runners up are van Persie and Evra. 

5. Remains to be seen. Consistent title contenders, well, I think both Liverpool and Man Utd will struggle with that in the future. Chelsea and City are too strong financially. 

6. Dunno. Any win is a great game. 

7. Sadly, I think Man Utd will win 3-1. Suarez will nutmeg Eva and score a beauty, van Persie will score two, and Sturridge will get injured.

generally, when you're asking what you should do while you're visiting a place it's a good idea to give some suggestions of things you like doing (should we bother suggesting the museum of anaesthesia?), where you're coming from (you might have a better version of what we think's cool) and anything you're particularly looking to avoid.

true,interfail,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Life is weird in this country. It can basically be anything from the rare whole life orders down to n-years without parole. Well behaved prisoners usually get out on parole first time.

It's this way because murder here carries a mandatory life sentence. I'm fine with this - it makes sense to me that a killer gets a minimum sentence and then the system gets to decide whether or not he is released depending on what happens to the guy in the intervening (say) 15 years.

For the minimum time served, the system is that they look at your crime, decide what your crime is and then use that to get a starter sentence, which is usually 15 years (most murders) or 30 years (more serious or more likely to recur). This is then modified up or down by the judge based on the particulars of the case. If you're bad enough, you can get a whole life order (life no parole). There's 60-100 of these in Britain.

It's hard to say what a typical life sentence is, since every crime is different really.

You are right about the larger house prices swinging a lot more too, Ive observed this in my area.

I too would go for the smaller house, if you've read 'The millionaire next door' - T.J Stanley &amp; W.D Danko (which I recommend even if it is slightly dated.)

They address this point, and via their research, began recommending people only mortgage 2x their annual salary.

Rose arrives with a backpack full of her belongings, tossing it to the Doctor and playfully telling him that he is now stuck with her. Rose says goodbye to Mickey and Jackie, assuring her mother that the TARDIS is a time machine — she can travel all over the universe and be back within ten seconds. Rose asks Mickey to come along with them but the Doctor, following Mickey's wishes, pretends that Mickey is not welcome.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"Yep, agree with all of this. 

&gt;Either the government works out why house builders are so bad at building houses - are there any real barriers? 

Interest rates are low, good investment opportunities are few and far between, house prices are rising, and property developers make most of their money on planning decisions. They make little or no profit on actually building and selling houses. 

As long as house prices are rising, it makes more sense for a property developer to hang on to his land bank. It's an appreciating asset, and he's getting  a better return than if he invested elsewhere or put his money in the bank. 

It takes about two years to build a housing estate, so the ideal time to cash out is two years before house prices peak. 

""Help to buy"" de-risks this process. It's a signal that the government intend house prices to keep rising, so the property developers can hang on to their land banks without risk of them losing money.

Planning minister Nick Boles has proposed that planning permission should expire if the landowner doesn't actually build something. This would be useful, but the usual vested interests will try to derail it.

There needs to be a way for the profit from a planning conversion to accrue to the local authority or even the house buyer, rather than to the property developers. This would be a quite radical reform so I don't expect it to happen any time soon.

The title was always going to be a big ask for you this season, and I thought we'd get a lot closer to you points-wise, but to see you disappearing into the rearview mirror with 10 games to go is both surprising and delightful. I think he lacks the support of a lot of the players. Utd need a total overhaul, get rid of RVP, Nani, Cleverly, Young, Vidic, Rio, Evra and a couple more, get young hungry replacements... Bit like, erm, Liverpool ;)
  
2. At the start I felt confident we'd challenge, though not necessarily get top four. Now I think we can get top three. Arsenal have tough games coming up. Top three means no CL qualifiers which would be nice.
3. Suarez will stay. I don't care who we sign as long as they are the right players at the right money. I wouldn't have wanted Mata at almost 40mil, seems way overpriced. A signing to suit the fans, not the team. We need a CB, LB, CDM, and a winger. Add Borini and Suso and we'll be good to go.
4. Urgh. Where to start. RVP, just. He's a money grabbing crock. Delicious irony that Arsenal are so much better than Utd this year. Honourable mentions to Evra, Januzaj and Nani.
5. It's not capitalising on Utd's weakness really. We'd still be on the same points total regardless, and Utd would be on course for a record breaking season if they were more than a couple of points ahead. Our attack is now one of the best in Europe, and with all the young lads the future is bright. I think title is too far this season. CL qualification and adding squad depth in the summer is essential. If they blow CL qualification from this place it could be another 3-4 years till we get another chance.
6. Liverpool 3-3 Man Utd. January 1994. Nigel Clough x2. Awesome.

I just finished a voluntary work placement at the local jobcentre.  Because I'm such a wonderful 'employee' I regularly arrived early so was often privy to the staff meetings held in the morning.  It seemed like not a single morning passed when I didn't hear about some new and wonderful scheme to help 16-24 year olds get into work, but nothing whatsoever for anyone over that age.

While I was working this placement (for about 2 months), not one, not two, but THREE other volunteers were plucked from my supervision and placed directly into paid work with essentially no effort on their part.  I don't begrudge these young people any success -- they need it and deserve it as much as I do -- but because I'm a whopping **TWENTY-SEVEN years old**, it apparently doesn't matter that I'm on the verge of homelessness and starvation, and I don't get any help despite the fact that I am (said as humbly as possible) by far the most effective, reliable, punctual, etc worker they have seen.  Bitter ain't the word.

I got a reference out of it.  That's all I was expecting when I started, and I was happy with it, but having seen all the wonderful extra help the others are getting I definitely feel short-changed.

You can get joint mortgages when one applicant isn't working but it typically means you won't be able to borrow as much as a single person applying without financially supporting someone else.

&gt; Almost amusingly, linked to the last point is that our A&amp;E has also lost its reputation as one of London's best trauma centres

http://jobs.kch.nhs.uk/job/-v304250?_ts=23

I have no idea if you work in paediatrics or not, but I am making the assumption that (skills and background side), there is no really pay difference between a paediatric A&amp;E nurse and an adult A&amp;E nurse.

So that's a Band 5 staff nurse, 37.5hrs a week with a salary between £25,666 to £33,481.

I'm going to assume that's using the Agenda for Change pay scales and does include the London weighting.

That's a reasonably decent salary and a lot better than many people earn, especially if you have a few years under your belt an can benefit from the increments.

No - you're confused about what the percentage is a percentage of.

What's important is the yield as a percentage of the initial investment.

&gt; e.g If I buy something that gives me 6% profit, and you buy something that makes 4%, I have made a better investment than you. 

No.  If you make 6% of $1  and I make 4% of $1 million with the same initial sum, then I clearly have made a better investment

&gt; And if we keep going long enough, I will be much richer than you

Yes, but you don't have ""long enough"".  At 6% of $1  it would take you 725 years to catch up to me at my 4% of $1million.

Using your example of the 200k vs 600k house, it would still take **140 years for you to catch up** (1.02^140 = 5*1.01^140 ).

Question 3 - Yeah. I think he'll stay for another season and have a crack at the Champions League, if we win something next season maybe he'll stick around. I'd like to see us get Kagawa from your lot, I think he'd do really well in our team. If not Kagawa, then the more expensive option choice would be Lalana.

Question 4 - Rio is a special kind of prick. Merk'd. 

Question 5 - Rodgers is showing that he's a really smart manager, still young enough to change and adapt. We are title challengers now, and with some sharp signings, can be next season too.

Well, one argument goes that rigidly-enforced rules on pronunciation are non-natural.

Essentially, it is taken as given that it is natural for languages to evolve over time since all of them do; at any given point in time many speakers of a language will be complaining about how this particular stage of change is a detriment to the language and what's actually happening is people are making mistakes.

It's not at all like changing the capital of England, since that's a codified and decided-upon fact.

1. It's no secret that scousers *despise* your side, but honestly I have much more respect for your success under SAF than, say, Chelsea or City's over the past decade or so. As for Moyes, yes he is struggling and it looks bad, but we had similar troubles under Rogers last year and look at us now. I think that if he is given enough time, he will start to win games and eventually trophies.
2. Realistically, 3rd. But I'm not giving up on the title yet with our remaining fixtures.
3. Assuming we finish top 4, yes, he will stay. No club or manager will give him the freedom that he has here. As for future signings, many were disappointed with the Konoplyanka saga, but I think our most glaring need is at LB/RB, Luke Shaw is a possibility.
4. This is the most difficult question for me, so much hate to go around. I have to go with Patrice Evra, with honourable mentions to Ashley Young and Phil Jones.
5. This season is absolutely not a flash in the pan. From the moment he was hired, BR has been clear about his plan for attacking football with an emphasis on possession and pressure high up the pitch, and that's exactly what he has delivered.
6. So many great fights between us over the years, but Dirk Kuyt's hat-trick at Anfield comes to mind.
7. I think it will be a difficult game at OT, but we'll win 1-3. Sorry.
8. 3rd for us, behind City and ahead of Arsenal. I think you will finish ahead of Spurs but behind Everton for 6th.

1.I don't think Moyes is up for it.  I do think you lot will do better next year if he stays on though. He's an intelligent manager and he did a wonderful job at Everton.  I think the problem may be he doesn't have the personality required to manage the big egos at a club the size of United.

2.I expect us to win the title.  Its a realistic expectation.

3.Suarez will stay unless the bottom falls out and Tottenham win every game left on the slate.

4.Rooney, always Rooney. He hasn't done much lately but I can't forget the long history of his despicable behavior. Evra, Giggs, RVP are also faces that would look better with a brick thru them.

5.Hard to say. Somehow, I'm not convinced that he's going to be the one that leads us back to the top which is really bizarre considering I just said I expect us to win the title just 3 questions back. It all feels like a dream really.  The best thing I can say for him is that he's made me get over Rafa leaving. Thats a miracle.

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"Question 1 Lets get it out of the way, what are your thoughts on Manchester United and in particular Moyes this season who has moved from your local rivals to your biggest rivals in football?

**This is the season I've been waiting for my whole life. My uncle and cousin are United fans and no one else on that side of my family even likes football, so I've had 20 years of grief from them. I always warned them that this would happen when Ferguson retires and they never believed me. It remains to be seen how much longer United stay like this, but I'm making sure I savour every minute of it.**

**Therefore, I'd give Moyes 26 years, just like Ferguson had. It's only fair, right?! ;)**

Question 2 What are your realistic expectations for this season?

**3rd or above. I'll be disappointed with 4th now. Had you offered me 4th eight months ago I'd have bitten your hand off, but I genuinely think 3rd or even 2nd is a realistic goal for us. 1st would be amazing but we'd have to do a lot of work in the meantime and I'm not convinced it will happen. I see no reason why we can't finish 2nd or 3rd though. 5th would be devastating.**

Question 3 Do you think Suarez will stay at Liverpool and who would you like to see the club sign.

**Provided we get Champions League football, I see no reason why he'd leave. Perhaps if we finish 4th he'd go, wary of the qualifier. But if we finish 3rd or above I see no reason why he'd want to leave. If he did, it better be for a world record fee or something somewhat close to it, because there's no doubting his talent and he's only entering his prime in the next year or two.**

Question 4 Who is you most hated Manchester United player and why?

**Robin van Persie. He's a knob.**

Question 5 Is Rodgers having one great season capitalising on United's weakness or is he turning you into genuine title contenders?

**There's no doubt this season is 'easier' because of the transitions at other clubs around us in the league (Fergie leaving United, Pellegrini taking time to get used to working at City), but that being said, I genuinely think we'll only get stronger from here, and may well be up in the same area of the table (or even higher) this time next year.**

Question 6 We have played against each other many times over the years. Which is your favourite game against us, and why?

**Other than the obvious 4-1, I'd say one of the ones that Murphy scored the winner in at the beginning of the century. I was a kid and had never had the pleasure of gloating a victory over United to my uncle and cousin before, so I milked that for all it was worth.  Fortunately we beat you fairly regularly after that for a good few years.**

Question 7 What are your predictions for the game this Sunday?

**I'm a mixture of nervous and excited.  My heart says we're going to stomp all over you and make your defence's life a complete and utter misery. I genuinely don't think any of your defenders, no matter where along the line they are or who you choose to put in the lineup, could deal with Sturridge, Suarez or Sterling. That being said, this is United vs Liverpool, so anything can happen.**

Selesnya (greenwhite) - Token shitting. They have a way of ""photocopying"" tokens on the field and then buffing them all. Lots of soldiers.

Dimir (blueblack) - Mill and curse. Lots of nasty creatures that include mill in their abilities.

Gruul (redgreen) - Big fucking creatures. They have creatures they can use as buff spells. So, instead of summoning a 4/4, you can sacrifice it to buff another creature by 4/4. They also have lots of little burns.

Orzhov (whiteblack) - Steal life. Lots of neat abilities to take life and gain it.

Simic (bluegreen) - Evolve is their thing. Basically, if someone summons a bigger creature than yours, it gets slightly bigger in return. Not my thing, its limited imo.

Rakdos (redblack) - Aggressive creatures that can sacrifice their ability to defend to do better attack damage.

Azorious (whiteblue) - Detain. They cancel spells and lock down creatures by ""detaining them"", which means they dont untap until YOUR next step. So, if you detain a creature, its unusable for their next turn, until your turn starts again. Good detain decks can entirely lock down the creature game.

Izzet (redblue) - Burn cancel. They are spell crazy. They cast, stop you casting, and fuck with everyones spells, hands, graveyards.. nightmare if they get rampant with it.

Golgari (greenblack) - Scavenge. They can basically bring their cards back from the dead to turn them into 1/1 tokens. So, say it dies, you can pay to ""scavenge"" 3 1/1 tokens to put on your active toons, and you have cards that fuck with the tokens. Like, cards that multiply the tokens you get, or the ability to move them around etc.

Boros (redwhite) - Highly aggressive. They drop creatures with ""battalion"". If it attacks with 2 other cards, it gets abilities. Like the card that, when it attacks with 2 other cards or more, they are all indestructible.

I see you also believe that fallacy that all male homosexuals take part in anal sex. But that is just showing your ignorance more than anything.

&gt;Nobody at election time stated they were going to push major social redefinitions through parliament.

The last labour government introduced the civil partnership act. It is only natural that as our society develops our laws develop with it. Plus am sure the Tories and Lib Dems wanted as most votes as possible and stating that view at the time would only lose votes and not increase them. The manifesto is also a guideline and not law. That's why we have increase tuition fees. 

The Queens speech? Does she write legislation? As she is a monarch and not voted in by the people her having a say wouldn't be very democratic.

&gt;Major social changes.

Like I have said, social changes that don't effect you.

&gt;Considering a good proportion of our current Labour opposition supported paedophilia groups would you be happy for child sex laws to be changed without giving you an opportunity to have a say on the matter?

true,fatfook,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"&gt; Solution : Build more houses

Have you seen the state of the roads/hospitals/GP surgeries/schools/utilities etc. Building houses is great but let's at least also build everything else that goes with it or we just overload what we have and it makes life even more miserable than an overpriced house in negative equity. Traditionally, I only see houses being built. In my village for example in the last 20 years I've seen house numbers grow by close to a 50%, most of these where they have knocked down large houses and in some instances built 30 in the space where just one stood. Now the village is gridlocked several times a week. The trains are full to capacity before they even get to the station (this is 30 miles out of London too) There has been no extra capacity at the doctors, schools and the sewage system is under threat. I see this throughout the county where you can throw up a jerry built rabbit hutch and grab £200k per bedroom for it. Some new build places up the road from me want £60k extra to have access to a garage!

When the social housing was sold, this country was fucked. It's forced so many into debt and made us a nation of landlords, swanning about collecting rent and bleating when someone can't pay their exorbitant rates. The only alternative is private accommodation, 'leased' to the council which we in turn are funding as tax payers. When there was social housing stock, this was bought and paid for property available to those less well off, rented extremely cheaply. Now you max out your housing benefit and have to find another grand a month just to keep a roof over your family's head, whilst keeping the landlord away from a proper job. It's fucking scandalous, particularly when you discover how many of the aristocracy and political cronies have a raft of ex-local authority properties on their 'portfolio'.

true,interfail,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Joint sentencing is the norm for linked crimes. For example, if you're tried for enslaving someone, and beating said slave, you'd be sentenced together since the crimes are inextricably linked. This usually results in a lesser sentence than individual trial and sentencing, since a single criminal act may breach several independent laws. This called concurrent sentencing, and it usually leads to harsher initial sentences, but shorter overall time since the person is in for every crime at once.

However, it doesn't have to be this way. The court can give consecutive sentences. Court guidelines recommend this in 3 cases: unrelated criminal incidents, a combination where it is important that each event be recorded separately (which could mean anything, really) and to require an appropriate sentence where concurrent sentencing would fail due to minimum sentences.

In other words, giving them consecutive sentences to get around minimum sentencing is explicitly mentioned in the judiciary guidance documents, but obviously this requires them to be charged with (and found guilty of) multiple offences. I would say that it's different in that you can stack up lots of offences, but never end up with the open-ended power of a life sentence (where they don't actually ever have to be released, although they probably will be).",0,1394574350,null,0,false,0,cg05zxl,t3_205a7b,t1_cg05zxl,t1_cg05ggn,null,1432758076,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,CastrosExplodinCigar,,Randalstown,"I would have liked to see your angry reply but I'll settle for this and thank you for responding with a very thought out and considered response.

- I know there were a lot of women there to discuss a wealth of issues. Fionula McCann in the Irish Times had a good piece on it the Friday before, as well as the Newsletter (I didn't spot it in the online version of the Irish News or Bel Tel).

- I really don't understand your point about everyone being naked except for their clothes. I read Cara's speech which is why I said I applaud the message but not the delivery (Although I understand she is a very accomplished speaker, her outfit did not suit the message). If memory serves me correctly, Parliament Buildings has a dress code if you're a member and you want to sit in the chamber, men must wear ties etc. The same rules should be applied to guests. And her necklace clearly didn't cover her breasts.

- The Belfast Telegraph reporting on Cara. I understand where you are coming from on this but news is what people are talking about and this would clearly get people talking about the event. Which is why I believe that Cara wore what she wore because she wanted people to talk about her. By her saying, I wasn't going to trivilise myself and wear a chastity belt, well, you've kinda done that by wearing a burlesque outfit (Corset and feathers). As for the photographer sneaking behind the podium. I don't know Justin K, but from my experience of seeing press photographers in action, they walk about looking for the best shot they can get. Whether it be standing on the balcony, pulling seats out and standing on them, moving furniture. Photographers do that and are generally given a free reign to do so. Also, the photographer may have supplied a contact sheet to the Bel Tel who then reviewed and selected the photographs they thought would best suit their editorial. In this case, it's a sensationalist, attention seeking speaker at Parliament Buildings.

- She has raised her profile. How many people had heard of her last week? Now we know she's from Derry/Londonderry, an Irish language activist, radio presenter and performer. She has damaged everyone else, including the Green Party who hosted and defended the event. 

Take the person who held up a Jesus is a Fag placard at the Pride march a few years ago. Sensationalism and attention seeking sells papers and that is what people will focus on and remember. I can't remember the gentlemans name (I think it was PA McLaughlin) but he was on the radio the next Monday trying desperately to defend it when he should have washed his hands of it if you'll excuse the reference. The girl who held that sign was clearly out to cause offence and/or make a ridiculous statement.

- We will never know if the Bel Tel would have reported on the event had it not been for Caras outfit because, in my opinion, she wanted the limelight for herself. 

- Accusations of cheap and lazy journalism are the last cry of someone who knows they are in the wrong. It's like the US Republican Party shouting Lamestream media every time CNN or MSNBC or WSJ takes a swipe at them. It's even as bad as Ian Paisley JR accusing the BBC of standing for Better Be Catholic when they reported on his links with the property developer. The Green Party never complained about the Bel Tel until it focused on them and to do so now, seems like they are clutching at straws.

- I'm sorry I don't blame the Bel Tel or Steven Nolan or the Photographer. I think Cara's stunt has focused the spotlight, not on the speeches, the important messages and International Women's Day but on herself. Which I wonder if that is what she wanted all along. I read today that she's in talks with TG4 to film her as she wants to live in a caravan for a year as part of a fly on the wall doc. It's all publicity.

Round my way there is a whole generation that has been left on the scrap-heap, even when the workers tried to buy-out the mines the management flooded them instead. The two are simply not comparable and the Right rather than taking pot-shots should begin to start to take responsibility for some of the damage that Thatchers policies had on the wider economy, rather than acting like anyone who argues against her are just communists and she 'saved' the country. All Bob Crow did was help people to stand up for each other, how many lives did he ruin? How many peoples benefits did he take away? How many immigrants did he villify saying we were being swamped? How many terrorist leaders did he help keep locked up in S.Africa? How many people were rioting in the streets against policies that he was bringing in?

true,Unicross,flare-brum,City Centre  - Formerly of Kings Heath,"Hi!

Welcome to Brum! On to things to do:


City Centre Places to visit:

1. [The Library of Birmingham](http://www.libraryofbirmingham.com/):This is open after a move from the old Central Library at Paradise Forum.  look forward to poking your nose round, the Shakespeare room looks amazing.
2. [BMAG](http://www.bmag.org.uk/birmingham-museum/):The Main Museum by Victoria Square is a great place to go to, it has the largest collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings in the world and the Staffordshire hoard too. The newly opened [Birmingham Exhibit](http://www.bmag.org.uk/new-birmingham-history-galleries) is definitely worth a wander around and will give you a background on your new adoptive city.
3. [Thinktank](http://www.thinktank.ac/): At Millennium Point is a great interactive science display to go and see (tailored more towards kids but still fun for adults too!).
4. [The Back to Backs](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/birmingham-back-to-backs/): The only National Trust place inside the city centre. A row of preserved 19th Century houses originally built for workers, definitely worth a visit.
5. [The Ikon Gallery](http://www.ikon-gallery.co.uk/) in Brindleyplace is the hub for more modern arts, but is free has a good cafe and a nice courtyard and definitely a good few hours worth of entertainment.
6. [The Sea Life Centre](http://www.visitsealife.com/birmingham/) round the corner from the Ikon is also a good place for a few hours, especially if you have little ones in tow.
7. And if you're a fan of chocolate there's of course [Cadbury World](http://www.cadburyworld.co.uk/). No need for an explanation here I think!
8. [The Electric Cinema](http://www.theelectric.co.uk/) is the UK's oldest working cinema (licenced bar too!). It shows a great eclectic mix of blockbusters, Indies and golden oldies.

Shopping

1. [The Mailbox](http://www.mailboxlife.com/). Plenty to see and do here. Many High End shops, and eateries (Pennyblacks is a particular favourite of mine). There's also a few hotels around if you end up staying late.
2. [The Markets](http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/bullringmarkets) Are worth a visit if you're after, well, pretty much anything! Split into three main markets: [The Open Market](http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&amp;childpagename=Markets%2FPageLayout&amp;cid=1223092598418&amp;pagename=BCC%2FCommon%2FWrapper%2FWrapper) is the place to go for cheap fruit and veg shopping (early mornings are best), with a wide range of local and exotic fruit and veg. [The Rag Market](http://www.ragmarket.com/) Has a wide range of goods from fabrics, to electricals and general handy stuff. Finally, [The Indoor Market](http://www.bullringindoormarket.net/index.html) is the place to go for Meat, Fish and Exotic foods, with ample parking above it. There's an AMAZING little sushi place in there called [suishi Passion](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sushi-Passion/212584485422108) which I urge you to try.
3. The Big One... [The Bullring](http://www.bullring.co.uk/), which I'm sure you've probably heard of is the main shopping centre coming up to it's 10th Birthday. It's got over 160 shops including Selfridges, a mahoosive Debenhams, and a TK Maxx which I can never get the missus out of. Right next door to the currently being refurbished [New St Station](http://www.newstreetnewstart.co.uk/) (due to have it's own shopping centre and John Lewis within the next year or so). A new eating development has just been added at the bottom of the Bullring called Spiceal Street, with a few nice restaurants and a Jamie's Italian which is worth a visit
4. [The Pavillions](http://www.pavilionsshopping.com/) situated next to the Bullring from the other side of Markets has a few good shops, a large Waterstones and a good food court upstairs if you ever get bored of the Bullring.

Dining Out and Drinking


1. Apart from the aforementioned Mailbox and Bullring

2. A short walk down the canal from the Mailbox is [Brindleyplace](http://www.brindleyplace.com/), opposite the ICC. Brindleyplace again is full of restaurants and bars (mostly chains; Pitcher &amp; Piano, Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Handmade Burger Co., Cafe Rouge, Pizza Express, Carluccios, etc). Personally I recommend [Chilaccas](http://chilacas.co.uk/), great little burrito place open late, if you're on the way back from Broad Street.

3. Talking of [Broad Street](http://www.broadstreetbirmingham.com/). Birmingham's 'Premier' drinking location. Nice in the week but I avoid it like the plague on a weekend as It's usually full of Stag Do's, Hen Nights and Students who've had a few too many beers.

4. For an alternate drinking / shopping venue[The Custard factory](http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/), south of the City Centre in Digbeth is good. Plenty of vintage shops, eclectic bars, and the [Digbeth Dining Club](http://www.digbethdiningclub.co.uk/) on Fridays is a great place to meet people and enjoy some of Britain's best street food.

5. [Moseley](http://www.moseleycdt.com/) is described as an urban village. about 15 minutes by bus from the city centre it's basically Birmingham's version of Carnaby Street / Soho. Lots of independent shops, craft fairs and farmers markets. And a few great Pubs too. recommended are [The Prince of Wales](http://www.theprincemoseley.co.uk/), [The Bulls Head](http://bullsheadmoseley.co.uk/) and the [Fighting Cocks](http://www.thefightingcocksmoseley.co.uk/) are great pubs if you want to stay away from the chains.

6. Harborne, again about 15 mins bus ride is also great for a few ales, with some good bars, eateries and a few stand out pubs.

7. Around the city itself, there's a funky collection of Pubs and Bars called [Bitters'n'Twisted](http://www.bittersntwisted.co.uk/) Each is unique, The Victoria doing amazing soul food, The Jekyll and Hyde with a gin bar and film evenings, all worth a visit.

8. Chinatown and the [Arcadian](http://www.thearcadian.co.uk/) is great for food and there's a few funky restaurants and bars. [Le Truc](http://letruc.co.uk/) is a personal favourite.

Parks 

The two main parks in the city are:

1. [Sutton](http://www.sp.scnhs.org.uk/) is one of the largest parks in the UK, you could spend at least a few days exploring all nooks and crannies. 

2. [Cannon Hill](http://www.cannonhillpeoplespark.net/) is much smaller but no less exciting, there''s a boating lake, tennis courts, mini golf and events throughout the year. If you're up for a run there's a free 5k [Parkrun](http://www.parkrun.org.uk/cannon-hill/) event every Saturday morning at 9am. Maybe see you there ;-) 

This is nowhere near an exhaustive list, at barely starts to cover all the independent, bars, clubs, and places to go. I find new things to see and do every month.
Enjoy your time in the city and may be see you around!",0,1394575552,null,0,1394795499,0,cg06l8j,t3_1zz5xs,t1_cg06l8j,t3_1zz5xs,null,1432758355,9,false,brum,t5_2rdjk,9

Why not?  Because they're British and those who come here aren't?  The (large) majority of people who come are young, healthy, and looking for work - not old, unhealthy, and looking to sit back on their pensions.

true,KopiteKing13,lfcflame,,"&gt;After his horrible attempt of a pass against West Brom leading to the 1-1 goal, I buried my head deep into my hands pondering what the intention of that pass was. I’m not going to be too critical because he seemed very fresh in the start of the season, maybe we’ll be lucky enough to see that side soon again. Although we’ve only seen this friendly giant feature for us a total of 12 times, he seems to be the sharpest of the bunch. I was always happy to see him on the team sheet, I felt confident with him in our back four. We haven’t seen too much of him yet, making it hard to really rate him properly. He’s got a decent amount of pace for such a big beast of a man, and lacking in physicality would be the joke of the year. Being a reasonably young 24 year old, I’m very excited to see what he will do for us in the coming years.

Here you go from talking about Kolo to talking about Sakho without even mentioning Sakho or transitioning from one to the other. The flow of the sentences makes it seem as though you're talking about the same person, but the only things that gave it away were you started talking about how he's ""a beast of a man"" and is a ""young 24 years old"". Kolo definitely is not 24.

Other than that I think it's a good write-up. Pretty good analysis and all. Just some proofreading needed and maybe divide it up into paragraphs; perhaps one on each player. It would make it much easier to read.

With regards to our CBs, I just can't help but think that at least 2 of them aren't good enough for us. Skrtel and Toure. I like Skrtel, but he's **never** filled me with confidence.  This might be a too simplistic way of looking at things, but Skrtel has been here for the duration of our recent troubles in the past few years. As soon as we lost the impact and maturity of Hyypia, we struggled.

Of course, I'm not saying our troubles are down to Hyypia leaving or Skrtel playing more...far from it. But Skrtel has been a Liverpool player for 5 or 6 years now and he's always been a polarising player. He'll have one great stretch of games (even a great season), followed by a period where he's complete and utter shit. Then, after a while, he'll revert back to being a monster in the heart of our defence.  When he's good, he's fucking good. When he's not, he makes **way** too many mistakes for my liking.  I honestly think time may have run its course with Skrtel. I'd rather bring in a younger replacement and allow Rodgers to mould him into the style of player that befits the rest of the team.

The other defender I'd move on, or at least look to move into more of a background role, is Toure. He was never going to be a long term solution. In fact, if Carra hadn't retired we'd never have even gone for Toure. He was brought in solely to play the Carra/Sami type role: maturity and experience. You cannot underestimate the importance of this role....but when our defence is as thin as it is, having to rely on Kolo for 15-20 games a season like we have so far is never a good idea.

We need to bring in 2 CBs this summer. Our attack is nigh-on perfect. One more wide-playing goalscorer and a midfielder of some sort and we'll score 100 goals next season. Our defence, as much as I like them, is holding us back though. Fix that and we'll go far.

Just a few last points-

I shouldn't have used the word 'sneak,' that was inappropriate, but from what I've read it seems that Cara's breasts were concealed to the audience by her necklace, as the audience were front-facing. If I remember right, Steven Agnew tweeted that he didn't even know she wasn't wearing anything under, because she wore a jacket the rest of the evening.

I'm not sure it was a 'corset' as much as a dress with no breast cups, but I won't split hairs- and still, her point, made through her outfit, about cultural norms shaming bodies, and shaming people that are confident in their bodies, stands, and is even supported by media and political reaction. And even if there are requirements for male members in Stormont, I got the impression that the evening was about larger social attitudes towards how everyone's judged, so it would make sense to flaunt those rules (as the evening was a kind of protest) rather than make a meeker speech.

I'm sorry, but I'm not accusing the Bel Tel of cheap journalism lightly- having made no serious attempt to report the event, they focused on, and distorted, one aspect of it, to gain online views and sell papers. It's them that sold the sensationalism, which was not a focus of Cara Park's speech, or any part of the evening.

And sure, even if it was just to get attention, has it not got people speaking and debating body-shaming and feminism in the media? Surely that's a success for women's rights?

I guess the core differences between our views is that you think the Bel Tel is reporting sensationalism *as a result* of Cara, where I think they used Cara *to be sensationalist*. I just don't have the distrust in her to lay blame at her feet, and the Bel Tel has an agenda of selling papers just as much (and perhaps more) than Cara has of getting recognised.

Not quite, Salmond opposed it being on the same ballot paper as independence, not because it would ""confuse"" Scots, but because it would be ""undemocratic"". This left it open to the possibility of being part of a separate vote. 

But Cameron ruled it out, because ""additional powers for the Scottish Parliament is inconsistent with remaining a part of the United Kingdom,"" shutting down any option of a vote. Again, not because it would ""confuse"" people.

If Sturgeon is making noises against devo max *now*, it is because *she's campaigning for independence.* As Bruce Crawford MSP, the SNP minister for government strategy, said back in 2012: ""We believe independence is the best future for Scotland, but we support the right of people to advance the case for a 'devo-max' option in the referendum consultation.""",0,1394578146,null,0,false,0,cg07sw2,t3_202xqh,t1_cg07sw2,t1_cfzq9sc,null,1432758925,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;There is also a debate in relation to the validity or invalidity of a clause imposing an additional amount to the loan price (rather than a ban) for fielding the player. While in principle there is nothing wrong in establishing additional amounts in case of fulfillment by the player of certain objectives, if the amount is disproportionate it could be seen as an indirect way to prevent the player from playing against his parent club. Another problem with these additional sums (and the confirmation of the club’s intention) is that clubs usually refer to them in the contract as “penalties” or “fines” for fielding the player.

It very well could be that there is a huge fee associated with playing that player against the parent club.

And that is, that if you look at the figures for the whole of the period under study, 1995-2011, immigration has been a drain on the public purse. To the tune of about £95bn.

&gt; So how can that be? How can the picture be so radically different if you look six years further into the past?

&gt; It's because these figures include all immigrants living in the UK at that time - so, not just recent arrivals, but people who'd been in the UK for, in some cases, decades.

(these are the next quoted paragraphs from your link)

And actually if you read the actual report then it makes some massive assumptions about what 'immigrants' are, including counting all children of immigrants as immigrants up until the point where they start paying tax, whereupon they suddenly become nationals.

I think there are many arguments against immigration, but I'm not convinced the financial one is something that works.

Edit:

So from the list i linked above the only countries more densely populated than London are Macau, Monaco, Hong Kong and Singapore.

I entirely understand what you are saying; the UK can feel crowded, however this is demonstrably because of how our towns and cities are organised, rather than because the country is creaking at the seams.

I am not trying to imply that anyone who feels the country to be crowded is a bigot, just that the perception is not an unalterable reality. We can support a higher population, and with some reorganisation of our urban areas, do so in a less crowded way.

Obviously that is not in itself an argument for immigration, just that any population growth, be that from immigration or natural expansion, doesn't have to make the country feel more crowded.",0,1394579212,null,0,1394579729,0,cg08ah1,t3_204xrk,t1_cg08ah1,t1_cg06mql,null,1432759224,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,fameistheproduct,null,null,"It's actually quite easy if you follow a few simple rules. However, these rules also explain why the housing crisis wont get better until it's too late.

1- Before you start thinking about how to fix it, realise that there's no money in fixing the housing crisis.

Housing is expensive/overpriced and the only way to fix it is lower prices. no one who has property, works in the industry, or works to facilitate mortgages wants this. Anything done to fix the housing crisis will lead to lower prices (real or nominal). So most the ideas put forward by politicians and the industry are as best lip service or worse more of the same that got us into this crisis.

When I say there's no money, I mean that we can either have good value housing, or a property bubble. The problem is that the property bubble benefits everyone who has property and more importantly those that facilitate it (Banks).

And yes, I know people will say that ""it's because we're not building houses, it's the immigrants, it's foreign buyers etc.."" But I would like to point out the last time property inflation slowed (and dropped in some parts) was in 2008/2009. Did was see a massive drop in immigrants? - no the system that lets us borrow insane amounts of money came to a grinding halt.

2- Politicians need to do what is right, before they do what is in there self interest. They own property themselves, some of them own a lot, some of them think that they own a lot but are in fact over indebted to the banking industry.

3- People who buy a house to rent it out shouldn't get a tax advantage over people who buy a house to live in it. In 1997 when Tony Blair and Gordon Brown introduced tax relief on mortgage interest they put the idea of speculators before savers. This has caused a lot of problems in other industries (ask anyone who works for Boots, or the RAC) but none so detrimental to our society as it has in housing. The problem now is that you cannot go back as thousands of people had the idea of buying a house so that the mortgage payment is covered by the rental income. Problem is that people buy houses with money they borrow and rent with money they earn. It works on the way up, but breaks on the way down.

Fixing housing in the UK is like getting turkeys to vote for Christmas.",0,1394579870,null,0,false,0,cg08l99,t3_205gjm,t1_cg08l99,t1_cfzzm2c,null,1432759365,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

In social care (in my experience) they are often looking for people who have a bit of common sense and that actually give a shit about helping others. It sounds like you fit that criteria and will fit in somewhere.

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"Let me get something out of the way, which I've not hidden in the past but I don't want to be accused of hiding now. I work for a financial institution in a regulated job related to mortgages and rate pricing. I'm a professional authorised by the FCA. I am being honest here, and not speaking for the benefit of my own pocket or my company.

Something you may not be taking into account is the possibility of keeping house prices static, by explicit government policy in terms of inflation, but allowing the value to fall when compared to the average wage.

This would cause a relative fall in house prices over a long period of time, without any negative equity problems.

I have explained in the past why a correction or fall in house prices is not desirable, I'll briefly do it here...

At the moment people pay a significant premium for a mortgage over 60 to 65% LTV. This is because above this LTV there is a tangible risk that the bank may not be able to repossess and sell and get all of their money back. It's also there because at low LTVs a downsize is possible, but at higher LTVs it is not. The more uncertainty there is about house prices the more that premium is. Remove the uncertainty and the premium goes and it greatly helps first time buyers. It also makes mortgage credit policy looser, which makes mortgages easier to obtain - although at the moment mortgages are easy to obtain for anyone with a credit history that isn't ruined, and can afford it and can evidence affordability for a few years.

Banks don't like housing bubbles at all. Banks prefer stability. For the health of our mortgage books we want to see properties that will increase in equity over time, but most importantly we cannot entertain the idea of a correction, and we price to compensate for it, hurting first time buyers. 

A sudden correction in house prices would see a generation of people trapped in negative equity - and the ones who are already trapped, trapped further. I've seen it argued that this doesn't affect anyone who doesn't view their house as an asset but that's bollocks. Some areas of the UK already have 15% of borrowers in negative equity already. It means they struggle to move (the FCA has let it be known it expects lenders to try to assist here but without the ability to switch lender that's moot) and more importantly they get the worst of mortgage rates paying in many cases far, far more than 90% LTV rates.

So I think with a correction ruled out, and a continued increase ruled out then the only thing left is for static house prices - essentially for them to grow no less than inflation, but no more than average wages.

Before doing anything the government should take steps to fix what it can in the market - this means for example if any sensible rules about empty properties can be created, and also rules about how long land can be held for speculation before properties are built on it.

Once this is done the government can then create a scheme to keep house prices between these two points, and they can do that by paying for houses to be built. It can be done in areas where house prices are rising too fast, and scaled back in areas where house prices are not. This will add to the stock of social housing in the UK and will continue to increase the amount of private ownership of houses.

I never thought Moyes would do well in a big club like United, he's the kind of gaffer that'll make wonders for underdog teams but he has no place in a club that's expected to dominate games, let alone the entire league.
* 2 
Back in pre-season I would've said that I'd be more than happy if we made a serious challenge for a CL spot. Today i think a 3rd place would make a realistic expectation.
* 3
Yes, there's no doubt in my mind we'll finally get that sought-after champions leauge spot again. Champions League is what Luis wants, it's what he'll get and he'll stay.
* 4
Can I still say Gary Neville? There are few players in PL history I've held so much contempt for as Neville. As a pundit, however, I've got nothing against him. In your current squad I'd say it's probably Ferdinand, imo he's well overrated and his bitching on twitter doesn't help his cause in my eyes.
* 5
This season is surpassing expectations. Where Brendan has lead us this season is where I believe we'd be in maybe 3 or 4 seasons. I always believed Brendan would make the team a genuine title contender again, and though I wouldn't say we are this year, he's certainly made more progress already than I could've hoped for.
* 6
I'll have to say the 4-1 victory at the Theatre of Dreams. Who'd have thought Dossena would score the 4th goal twice in a row against ManU and Real Madrid?!?!
* 7
I have a tendency to jinx every game I try to predict, but I'd say a Liverpool W.
* 8 
Liverpool. 3rd. Possibly 4th if Arsenal get their shit together but I firmly believe we'll make the CL this year. As for United, I do believe (and hope, fingers crossed) that Spurs can shrug you off for fifth place and I believe you'll finish 6th. I do however hope that Everton'll nudge you down to 7th and make my love-hate relationship with the blues even more complicated.

I usually keep an open mind to new UIs and site layouts, this is looking a bit crap, although it has the potential to look good with a bit of work. It annoys me that one side of the middle section is [semi transparent, but the other side isn't](http://i.imgur.com/00WTbLa.png). Also, it's 2014, can they not make a site that takes advantage of a wider screen whilst still being useable for people with smaller screens? The site design does seem fitting for a wide screen, yet like so many sites, all the content is stuck in the middle of the screen with wasted blank space to the left and right. The [new player](http://i.imgur.com/YAjzRA4.png) is also a bit ugly in my opinion, and it's really annoying that you can't scroll through programmes with the mouse.

I do like the pop up list for [Today's most popular](http://i.imgur.com/Cpl5TED.png), I'd like to see that used a bit more, perhaps for the favourites section. The [TV guide](http://i.imgur.com/Bbx8N4g.png) page is also better than the old one, though that could also do with utilising the extra space of a wider screen. It's nice to have the ability to change your location, instead of it always being assumed to be London.

Obviously this is still in beta, so it's likely to improve with peoples feedback, but as of now, I prefer the old layout.

true,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,"Great write-up! Thanks for sharing. 

The problem with our defence is that it isn't as much of a problem as everyone says, IMO. Here's why: 

People usually have the go-to statement of ""you've shipped 35 goals, a huge chunk of those (23) away from home, which is the second largest amount in the top 10 and quite ridiculous for the top four"". However, what they leave out is that Arsenal have conceded 28 and Manchester City 27; our much-maligned defence, analysed and criticised every week, has let in only **seven** more goals than a team (Arsenal) who have been praised for their incredible defensive qualities this season. Sure, 5 of those goals came at our behest, but we're not looking as to which teams have scored those goals, just that Arsenal -- as a collective unit -- shipped that many goals.

Another point to add onto that is that all other teams within the top six have had their *strongest, first-choice* defence out nearly all season. Depending on your preferences, we've had our ""best"" back four out maybe...three times, if you're that way inclined? Certainly, Toure and Skrtel aren't the best CB pairing, and not many would choose Cissokho on the left over other players, but it's how we've had to deal with an abundance of injuries and that has undoubtedly led to more goals being conceded.

Let me just remind you -- with our second, maybe even third, choice defence, we've only conceded **seven** more goals than Arsenal. We've only conceded **eight** more goals than City, who've spent millions upon millions reinforcing their back line. Suddenly, it just doesn't seem that bad because, well, it isn't. Couple that with scoring the most amount of goals in the PL this season at the moment, and it's a much stronger position than anyone within the media is giving us credit for.

Of course, as with most sane LFC fans, I'm not trying to condone our conceding of that many goals just as I'm not attempting to paper over the cracks that are evidently there, but it isn't that damning an indictment when compared rationally and statistically.

I still think that Bentelab should have been loaned out and Holtby should be in our squad.  There is absolutely no reason to dump 100 million on a shit load of new players if you are not going to play them.

Its all about dat social standing, yo. Up 'till the late 70s living in a council house was par for course in the North West for example, now its seen as a front row seat in the ghetto.

So, what's the solution a new adjective? Community Housing? Sounds like some kind of mental health cost cutting scheme.

I think that the history would disagree with you. The problem is that banks don't have any skin in the game. The contract of debt people take on is secured on the property, but if the property is repossessed and sold on at a loss the bank is able to chase the borrower for the shortfall.

If banks didn't like bubbles then they would have stopped lending on over priced property long ago, but they don't. Not because of regulation of the property market, but lack of regulation in the banking market.

furthermore banks made more and more money from facilitating the debt. 

Sure a sudden drop in property prices would see those that buy houses to live in them keep living in them (costing them more than they expected), those that buy to speculate on property would get burned. I know there would be some people caught up in the market correction, but that's kind of what a market does. If people and banks liked it on the way up, then they shouldn't complain on the way down.

I don't understand why this sentiment is so popular. This is incredibly BAD for banks, politicians, and the economy in general in the long run (and not even the long long run, this could turn out very badly over a period as short as 5-ish years) if it's really what they're aiming for.

My default reaction is never that there's some conspiracy, but that the people in charge are just too stupid/short-sighted to see how bad their decisions actually are. I mean, think about people you know: only a very tiny minority of real people would actually act in a way that is going to be truly detrimental to everyone in the long run in order to maintain a marginal current benefit. The majority of people might end up making decisions that they think are the right ones, but are actually bad because they just aren't smart or well-informed enough to know the difference.

We price this amount at exactly £0. If it goes all the way to repossession there is no other money to get. My institution doesn't do much repossession at all, it's the very last step we would take and we can almost always find a way around it. We lose a fortune on repossession as it is, plus it's just not good business. The FCA mandates that lenders lend on affordability not equity, so the idea that banks just lend because they can repossess and get their money back is gone, that was 10 years ago with self-cert mortgages and dodgy brokers.

&gt;If banks didn't like bubbles then they would have stopped lending on over priced property long ago, but they don't. Not because of regulation of the property market, but lack of regulation in the banking market.

We introduced LTV brackets for exactly that reason. There's no lack of regulation in the mortgage market, you wouldn't believe the amount that goes on!

&gt;If people and banks liked it on the way up, then they shouldn't complain on the way down.

He made some commotion and the mugger stopped. I picked myself up and the Turk came and stood next to me. We both looked at the mugger and just stood their. The mugger turned and ran.

I wanted call the police but the Turkish guy was adamant that he couldn't hang around. So I agreed not to call them, the guy had to get a bus so I walked him to the bus stop nearest to my flat and waited.

While we waited we talked about what he was doing, where he was working, and what he was studying, the problems he was having not being able to study at his flat or at work etc... I got his number and told him that I'd thank him properly. I didn't know what but I felt I should help him, even a little.

His bus came, and he left.  I jogged the minute it took to get back to the flat. I had thought that I had come away un scathed but after I took my jumper off I realised that my shirt had been ripped to shreds where the mugger had pulled me around. Luckily that was it.

Coincidently work was reselling some old computers around that time, so I bought one and then met up with him a couple of days later to present him with a Laptop to help with his studies. Not the best, but even today it would be just about useable.

I thought of him the other day, I hope he's since upgraded as Windows XP is about to reach EOL. ",0,1394587826,null,0,1394621231,0,cg0c1w7,t3_206sf2,t1_cg0c1w7,t3_206sf2,null,1432761001,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

I just hear this kind of stuff trotted out ad nauseum in the North without any kind of factual backup. There is a good argument that the 'killing' of the mines lifted an entire generation out of a life of emphysema and vicious industrial dismemberment it also improved social mobility. 

To add to the conjecture.


Sadly the 'mobility' seems to be getting on the Euston train at Wigan North Western and never coming back. Frankly I don't blame anyone who did that. The place is a fucking tip with scant control over its own destiny.

Manchester (i.e the 'spinningfields square mile') has boomed, but how much of the rest of Greater Manchester has actually benefitted? OK the house prices have risen on the major arterial routes, is that a benefit? How many jobs are actually being made in Wigan, Leigh, Bolton, Bury, Stretford, Wythenshawe etc that aren't directly or 1 step removed from direct government contracts? Look at that figure again and remove the amount of 'claims management' jobs in call centres too.

Note I don't live in the North West, I could say the same for Leeds, Brum, Nottingham, Newcastle etc. There is very little actual wealth generation in the regions. There is an AWFUL lot of wealth transfer and that seems to be counted as the same thing.

This is a big problem. Effectively London is subsidising the rest of England. This cannot continue, we need deep structural changes to change things. I don't believe anyone in any party has the balls to do this...
