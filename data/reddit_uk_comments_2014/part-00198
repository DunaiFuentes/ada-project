true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"Pienaar was such a liability so often last season- he came back from injury and we were significantly worse. That Spurs game was just shambolic, all he did was lose the ball, and whilst he was rarely that bad- he was very rarely good. 

What Pienaar has is defensive workrate, but it doesn't make up for his complete lack of influence in the final third. We need a player who will track back effectively and link up with Baines (not cut in at every opportunity ala the England side); but we also need a player who will be making killer passes, crosses and chipping in with goals when needed, and Pienaar is no longer that player. 

Osman is better, he has a lot of heart- but lacks ability. He came in and had some really, really great games (which Pienaar didn't)- that Villa game was huge for us... But he kills the tempo of our attacks with his slow thoughts and play, and when we are trying to play a high tempo passing game, he is not the man to have. Osman still has a place in the squad, but starting him regularly will seriously hurt us and damage the philosophy that Martinez is trying to implement. 

&gt; And Peinaar's loss through injury last season coincided with our downturn in form

Gota call bullshit on this. We got 1.68ppg in games he played 60 mins or more, and 2.05 overall last season. Our only real run of very poor form was the 3 games lost in 4 after the battering by Liverpool, where Pienaar was taken off at half time, because he was all over the place. He played then in the loss to Spurs (where he was taken off after an hour) and the loss to Chelsea, but he can't be blamed there. 

Then he got injured after the WHU game (where he was actually decent, in a poor game for us) and we went on a killing spree, playing our best football, pasting Cardiff, Swansea, Newcastle, Fulham and Arsenal... All whilst he was out of the team.

We were better with him out of the team.",0,1405123531,null,0,false,0,civ09bz,t3_2agkds,t1_civ09bz,t1_ciuzhpf,null,1434672659,5,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,5

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; We're as much of an economic basket case as they are really. Both of us need to sort things out.

That's the essence of it really. Neither country is ready for it.

I do think that the south, while far from perfect, is a lot better off in most respects. We don't run at a £10bn p.a. deficit, the majority of our workforce isn't employed in the public sector nor does a substantial chunk of our FDI comprise call centres. I'd argue our infrastructure is  generally a lot better as well, while conceding that their healthcare kicks our healthcare's ass.

&gt; As for rowdy unionists, if unification has happened there would obviously be less of them than there is today. I'd say the moderates would integrate much like the unionists of Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal did. Whereas the Loyalists would possibly stir up trouble but they showed in the troubles that they couldn't match the organisation of the republicans and couldn't do much more than shootings without collusion with security forces. I'd say they wouldn't be capable of restarting the troubles.

I'd rather not take the risk, nor would I trust the Gardaí to deal with it effectively. Even if it didn't reach Troubles-level of violence, I just don't think Irish society is capable of enduring what they endure up north nowadays on a regular basis. All the sectarian nonsense, the violence, bigotry, racism, general hatred would have to go before I'd be comfortable welcoming the north into the country.

&gt; The way I see it, if reunification has come to a vote then the economic and political conditions are suitable for it anyway. I can't see it happening in the first place otherwise.

That's a fair point. If SF has any sense, they'll be *very* careful about the timing of it and not push it before the right conditions come into being. I can't see those conditions occurring within a generation or two though.

I suppose you've made me realise - I'm not against unification/reunification *per se*, I'll judge it on its merits when or if it ever comes around. If I were to have a vote on it tomorrow though, it would be a definite 'No' from me.",0,1405124090,null,0,false,0,civ0hup,t3_2afrma,t1_civ0hup,t1_ciuzvif,null,1434672764,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

After reading some stuff on the TARDIS wikia, there are three possible explanations of how regeneration came to be.  1) Rassilon added a third strand of DNA to form a triple helix (although the wikia is a bit short on the details of this one), 2) exposure to the Untempered Schism *contributed* to the ability to regenerate (but it doesn't say *caused*), or 3) Rassilon ""invented"" regeneration while he was investigating a different form of regeneration - to repair damaged or decayed tissues - using biogenic molecules.  

The third one is really the only one with any explanation behind it, and the wikia also says that Rassilon imposed the 12-regeneration limit as a way to avoid decaying biogenic molecules.  So it seems like more of a technological limit rather than a legal one, and that every regeneration after the 12th will be riskier, with a higher potential of something going wrong or the regeneration failing altogether.

I think at some point during Matt Smith's run, maybe the Lake Silencio incident, the Doctor really did die or has been in hiding and the Master, now turned good and seeing how corrupt the time lords were, is helping/searching for something related to the Doctor. Remember during the Impossible Astronaut episode, we find out the Ponds had been with a much OLDER Doctor? I think that is a huge time gap where the Doctor could have set other things in motion. Also the Master's ""funeral"" almost parallels the Doctor's death, a burning of the body? Why not go in the TARDIS and bury it someplace else, River could pilot the TARDIS to another location. Wasn't there a ring on the Master's body on the burning pile, is that signifigant?
Next Clue: One odd thing about the 11th Doctor. What is the deal with his supposed ""memory loss?"" Your telling me he forgot how many people he killed when he destroyed Gallifrey in the time war? A huge event like that just isn't forgotten, especially the deeper details. He can forgive himself, but not forget. Why doesn't he remember? Its because its the Master and he doesn't know the whole story about the Time War. Another thing about his memory is his age, it keeps changing. Most of the time its mentioned as over 900. That's a little vague, and with the events of Lake Silencio, he's much older than 900, according to River. Also one last thing to think about....and River knows this. Rule NUMBER 1: The Doctor LIES!

true,drunkwithanxiety,num1,,"It's interesting, but I'd chunk out the scale as follows:

1-4

Then there's a gap

5 - 8 (SOTON can go either way)

Another gap

9 - 13

Gotta make a bit of an arbitrary split here

14 - 20

Even though the groups are differently sized, I think that's a more accurate representation of the bands of strengths of squads.  The top 4 were well better the next 4, and the rest of the table kind of withers away from 50 pts to 30 pts.  The teams from 9 - 13 aren't hapless, but they aren't hapful, either.  From 14 on down - they're just glad to be here.

Looking at it this way:

1 - 4:  .13 ppm (points per match)

5 - 8:  2.33 ppm

9 - 13:  2.10 ppm

14 - 20:  2.36 ppm

It's hard to assign West Ham to either the 3rd or 4th tier, so if we combine both tiers:

9 - 20:  2.25  ppm

Or combine 3 tiers:

5 - 20:  2.27 ppm  

If we look at scoring 2.36 ppm (the highest number above) that's almost 90 points for a season.

If we look at scoring 2.10 ppm (the lowest number above, except for the top 4) that's almost 80 points for a season.

Thus, I'm not concerned about the points Spurs dropped from pretty much Everton on down - you can't win them all, and occasionally matches that should be wins are draws, and draws are losses - it's a long season.  Spurs need to turn a couple of these drops to wins, and say grab 5 - 7 points from here which I think is eminently do-able - Spurs simply have more talent than those teams (except, maybe, United), and consistent play should be enough to improve that.  

Spurs also need to grab 5 - 7 points more from the top 4, and that's where the rubber will meet the road.  Right now, you can't even say, ""well Spurs almost had this match or that match""--maybe they could have eked a few points out of the Scum, but pretty much against Chelsea, City, and Liverpool, Spurs got shelled like London in WWII.

So it's a tall order.  The top 4 show no signs of falling back, really.  But whatever - everybody's tied for first, and hope springs eternal.

Approach 1, which is looking more likely right now, is that I get a 125 for my CBT and use that for a while. I'm looking at the CBF and CBR 125, and the YZF R125 as my primary choices. They're around the £2k marker, give or take. Once I'm more liquid in terms of finances, I can then do my A2 and step up to the 500cc bikes. I'm not worried about getting bored, because realistically, even though I like the sports bikes, I'm not a racer. The CBR and the YZF can both hit 70mph which the fastest I can legally go anyway, so for my normal commute a 125cc should be fine for a while. 

Approach 2 is to go straight in with the DAS for my A2 license and get something like the CBR500 or the ER6F. (I looked at the GS500 and the SV650; aesthetically, they're not my taste). It's the more expensive approach on every front: training, bike, insurance, and time, but they're better bikes that will be more enjoyable to ride. 

When I assess what's more important to me, I come to the conclusion that getting on a bike sooner rather than later is desirable, which is why I'm leaning heavily towards getting a 125cc now. 

Edit: Yep. I've decided I'll start off with the 125, get my full A2 next year, and then buy this [beauty](http://www.cycleworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/2015-Honda-CBR300R-Matte-Black-Metallic-Yellow.jpg)",0,1405125722,null,0,1405131170,0,civ11oe,t3_2adtb4,t1_civ11oe,t1_ciu9s62,null,1434672978,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2

At the top of the tier there is Madrid and Barca. Even United sold Ronaldo to Madrid and it was seen as the next step for him, not a side step.

Moving to a PL rival is why most people hate Torres or are very torn about it. He left us for a club that was, until that immediate moment, very much fighting for the same trophies we were. Which is why Suarez last year was on the verge of being crucified by fans. 95% of fans could understand him moving to Madrid or Barca. No one could accept Arsenal. And we were all proven right because we finished above them. 

So I wouldn't say anyone is more understanding in football. It's just that we aren't hurt as often. There is also a fairly well established hierarchy and most people don't hold it against players for leaving. Not too dissimilar to if a player left the Kansas City Royals to play for the Yankees.

In Moyes' last season, Pienaar's link with Baines, and his defensive work, allowed Baines the freedom to take defenses apart.  However, I think we clearly need a player who looks to pass first before taking a shot.  A slightly higher level example, but for the first month or so after Madrid sold Ozil to Arsenal, they were doing terribly, because they had four guys up front who always looked to shoot first, and ask questions later.  Once Ancelotti realized this and got his formation sorted from a 4-2-3-1 to a 4-3-3 with Di Maria in the middle, Madrid vastly improved.  If watching other teams has taught me anything, it's that a team that realizes that dribbling past four opponents is not going to happen, keeps possession and the attack going, and doesn't waste it is crucial to victory.  Look at Germany.  They play at the highest level like that.  They don't waste possession, they keep the ball moving, and are ruthless in taking chances.

true,Melberger,null,null,"Mangala for me.

He's a rough diamond, and if we don't pick up these players another club will and they'll polish him into a stalwart that gives a club 10 years service at the highest level. Sometimes you have to pay the big money for an emerging talent.

Mangala has all the attributes to be successful in the high line system we adopt under Pellegrini. Not many players are better suited to playing this system than him.

He has superb athleticism; he has pace, power, and has a great leap in the air - which is an advantage defensively and from an attacking perspective on set pieces.

He has strong technical ability, and reads the game well.

Benatia is probably the better all round centre half at this moment, and is a closer mould to Kompany. He's more disciplined, and steady, with a composed head.

But Mangala is better suited to our style of play IMO, and would compliment Kompany better. He also has the potential for much more further development, and he already has the quality to pair Kompany in the heart of our defence now.

Mangala is aggressive and a front foot defender, with him being young this has lead to him making errors, but that's to be expected. He is raw, once he develops he should be one of the finest centre halves in Europe.

I think too many people are judging Mangala negatively on his perceived reluctance to commit to us, while Benatia seemed keen.

Neither of them are City fans and they're both at different stages of their careers. I don't think you can look too much into this, if Mangala decides to come here then there will be no question of his commitment. This sentiment will be an irrelevance when you look at the pros and cons from a logical perspective of the two players respective merits and what they can bring to the team.

Also, by all accounts Mangala had a so-so season, while Benatia had a great one. I don't think too much can be drawn into this either.

Benatia is at his peak and Roma had a fantastic season last year, while Mangala is a young and reasonably raw player playing in a Porto side which had a relatively poor season.

But make no mistake Mangala is the real deal, he's probably more of a gamble than Benatia, but I think he's better suited to our style of play and has the potential to become a stalwart years to come here.

I think this is reflected in the lengths the club are going in trying to sign him.",0,1405128262,null,0,false,0,civ21f2,t3_2ah2jq,t1_civ21f2,t3_2ah2jq,null,1434673328,8,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,8
true,SatansBawsack,null,null,"I'm studying Law at Glasgow Uni currently and not the course you are looking at so please take what I say with a big pinch of salt.

With that said, I cannot see how employers can look favourably on a course -which in my opinion cannot effectively teach the fundamentals in such a short time- at the expense of others with full Law degrees.

I don't want this to sound pretentious or anything so forgive me if it does. Glasgow is the 5th best uni for Law in the UK (after Cambridge, Oxford, Kings and UCL).The 7/8 pillars that we learn up here will be similar to English law but will vary in their content. These pillars are taught, in their *most basic form*, over the course of two years (the quickest way of becoming a solicitor up here is the 2 year accelerated post grad degree). This gives only the most basic grasp of the areas of law, which are further extended by their respective courses at Honours level. 2 years is a push for such a volume of law, so to reduce that to one year (2 semesters) and effectively double the workload, is damn near impossible. I don't mean hard, I do mean impossible. Up here, the workload for two years is 240 credits: that's 2400 hours or 100 straight days of work (without stopping). Two semesters that you would do would be, say, 24 weeks, or 164 days. Effectively your sleep, travel times and social life would be eradicated, or you are sacrificing some learning and lucking out with questions in exams (which just makes for incompetent solicitors). It's just not feasible. If law was so easy to get a grasp of, then everyone would do bullshit degrees like philosophy (sorry to anyone who does it) then a post-grad in law. Its not easy. Its REALLY fucking hard.

As for law in general, it is not like anything you have done before. The style of questions and answers are totally unique. A mere interest is good, but if you think you are 'well versed' in the law, you are setting yourself up for a huge fall. It is far better to attempt such a course humble and willing to accept that mountains take time to climb. 'Well-versed' is a term I would only use for well-experienced solicitors and Advocates. These are the guys who the foreign firms contact, I should add, not the average solicitor on the High Street.

I'm sorry for the tone of this answer. I can feel the negativity myself, but in all honesty, these courses anger me in the way they churn out unprepared 'lawyers' with only the vaguest clue what they are talking about to the detriment of people who spend 5 years reading £100 textbooks to the point they can recite whole passages from cases dating from before they were born. There's a job crisis in the legal world just now, and this doesn't help.

Good luck, but if you do this course, be prepared, and get a shitload of placements at a few law firms or no-one will take a chance on you at the level you plan to work at.",0,1405128281,null,0,false,0,civ21pe,t3_2a9qtl,t1_civ21pe,t3_2a9qtl,null,1434673331,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0

&gt;__The sunburst flag__ is a flag associated with early [Irish nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_nationalism), and more recently, youth wings of [Irish republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_republican) groups such as [Na Fianna Éireann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na_Fianna_%C3%89ireann). The flag is first thought to have been used in 1858 by the [Irish Republican Brotherhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Brotherhood). The sunburst flag is still used today, by both republican groups and the [Irish language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language) group [Conradh na Gaeilge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conradh_na_Gaeilge).

Borini may prove useful in either situation. He can play out wide and likes to get between the lines. His energy may suit the diamond well.

They create a competitive environment where, in this case, civil servants are graded on how many claimants they sanction. So you have to be extremely careful about staff reward schemes not creating perverse incentives.

Raises and promotions should come with competence, responsibility, seniority, and experience. Objective measures are tricky, since measuring how much a person does, as opposed to how well they do it, will tend to benefit those who place quantity over quality. Perhaps satisfaction surveys, annual employee assessments, and the amount of an adviser's sanctions that have been overturned (the higher the number, the lower their score).

People are fed up, they have no hope, everything people are told to aspire to is so far beyond the average persons reach that happiness seems impossible.

You know what basically all the looting and most of the damage was for? Getting TV's, phones, and other consumer electronics.

This country is so commercialised, it's catching up with America, kids have been so brainwashed by advertising to think it's TV's and iPhones that will make them happy and get rid of that anger and sadness.

How do you think it feels to be told all day that a new TV, the latest iPhone, watch, or a fancy car is what will make you happy, that everyone else has better things than you, and live a better life because of it, but you can't afford to buy these things?

All day long people are told by their TV they're supposed to aspire to fame, material objects and showing off to the world, they need the new Xbox, the PS4 too, the latest iPhones, the latest designer clothes, the latest fancy car, the latest Ikea furniture. IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT YOU WILL BE THE ONLY PERSON WHO DOESN'T HAVE IT AND YOU'LL DIE ALONE. 

People are born into poverty, failed by the school system (if you don't fit in to the factory assembly line school system, you've had it), they're growing up reading about these celebrities that are so much happier and better than them, seeing their friends lie on Facebook about how happy they are ALL THE TIME, being told constantly to worry about anything in their life or it might kill them or negatively effect their already pitiful existence, bad breath was an early one (halitosis was the word that mouthwash companies so brilliantly exploited), now it's fucking gum cancer to sell mouthwash.

Don't even get me started on women, women have been turned into the most self conscious humans ever in existence, watch adverts directed at women, they have hairy legs, bad breath, a moustache growing, indigestion is some fucking cancerous disease, quickly go buy medication! 

If you pinch the skin on your belly, does it feel, sort of, flabby? Yeah? You're fat. You fat fucking bitch, buy this home exercise equipment. Then you spend a few months doing this shitty exercise and you realise you don't have rock hard abs already, so the product didn't work, you'd think people would blame the company for the product not working.. But they don't, they blame themselves. The perfect business. 

When you're really tired and you screw your face up in the mirror, do you get wrinkles on your face? If you do, everyone probably thinks you're fucking ugly and you'll die alone, buy this skin cream. 

All day long we're being told to live in fear and be unhappy with anything other than being 100% perfect, which is not fucking possible. 

Basically yeah, I'm rambling, people need to think that when thousands of people in different cities across the countries start rioting, there might be a problem with society rather than a load of ""chavs"" that we should ""send the army to deal with em"" (it's disgusting how often I saw this) just decided to be cunts for no reason.

There's no hope for young people who are depressed, most of them would adamantly argue they're not depressed, because 'showing emotion' is still a taboo for men in this fucked up world we live in, just the other day I heard a neighbour shout at his little boy for crying ""STOP THAT! What are you doing crying?? Crying is for little girls! Are you a little girl??!"" 

Yeah fuck you kid, man up bitch, bottle everything inside you and never talk about your emotions or you're weak.

The two are quite different. With an automatic release clause, player ‘y’ must be allowed to speak to purchasing club ‘x’ if the minimum release amount is offered. A ‘good faith’ clause means the parties are required to negotiate in good faith once a bid has been made. Importantly, a good faith clause does not automatically trigger the selling club to accept the offer.

The PFA were reported to have been arbitrating between the player and the club, and explaining to the player the likelihood of the clause standing up to a robust legal examination. As such, it was considered by the PFA that the clause was not an automatic release clause."" - http://www.danielgeey.com/buy-out-release-clauses-in-football-the-basics/

OK, my alternative to takeaway: **2 Minute Falafel**

* Red onion (optional)

* Hummus and/or Mayo
* Chilli sauce (optional, but recommended)

* Arrange 4 frozen falafel on a plate, microwave for 1:45
* Thinly slice a few slivers of red onion (I keep one in a bag in the fridge for this task)
* Slice an edge or lettuce or peel a few whole leaves
* Chop a few black olives
* When the pita pops, run a knife inside it and spread the hummus and/or mayor.
* Loosely pack with salad, onion and olives.
* When the microwave pings, slice the falafels in half, distribute around inside of pitas, squirt with chilli sauce as you dare and squash falafels flatter between the bread.
* Serve on same plate you microwaved which will hopefully still be warm.

true,basketballhater,newcr-1,Besic's new Lambo,"LM we definitely need someone.  Don't know who (maybe Moses?) but we can't just rely on Peinaar, which we won't.

Honestly, I don't really like Hibbo and I don't think he should be a backup for us if we want to achieve our goals this season.  He could be a last resort.  Oviedo will be back soon, so he can back up Baines but we need a backup for Coleman, maybe someone of Clyne's caliber.  Not awesome, but I feel he'd fit into the system well because he likes to run up, and has decent pace and passing.  CDM, I don't think we'll get Rodwell, but Besic I'd like to see so we can give him a try, I think he can be really good for us.  Gibson can cover back there if we need him to, also.  I don't think he'd be good enough to play AM, he's not skillful enough at passing or dribbling for me to play that position.  I'd love to see us go for Holtby if he's up for grabs he can cover both DM and AM, and he's an Everton fan.  I'd agree with you in not playing Alcaraz that much, and I'm sure we can get a decent talent for a free transfer or someone cheap.  I'd like to see us going for another striker too because I don't think we have the attacking power just yet to make much on an impact.  If we get one more striker plus Traroe on loan, we can also utilize Naismith in mid, which would help make our squad much more complete.  

Other than that, we'll have to manage our youth system very well.  I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of players get their first starts/ subs this season.",0,1405134184,null,0,false,0,civ4gt6,t3_2agkds,t1_civ4gt6,t3_2agkds,null,1434674614,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3

The reason I think that Chelsea/Mourinho are willing to sell is the same reason that he didn't do well for Belgium; they need him to be something he's not; technical, intricate, a strong passer who can play with his back to goal. Lukaku isn't these things. What he *is* is a finisher who has the strength to contest balls in air, and decent feet in traffic. He won't make the pass that unlocks a defense, or hold up play super well with his back to goal, but if you already have players who can play incisive balls to him, or lay in crosses, he can finish those chances.

And at 21, he's got time to get better at all of that. I think Chelsea are crazy if they sell him, but I'm not going to let that stop me from hoping they're dumb enough to sell him to us.

EDIT; let me clarify what I mean by ""hold up play"" - he's fine if all he's doing is taking long-balls out of the back, winning headers, and laying the ball off. But he's not great when you're passing the ball into his feet in or near the box with his back to goal. He's not a Drogba-type player who can ""create"" goals in that situation; He needs incisive passing or space to run at; he won't often create his own shot, but his finishing touch is very good for his young age and how unsettled h'e s been so far in England.",0,1405136793,null,0,1405137147,0,civ5inm,t3_2afegk,t1_civ5inm,t1_ciuiq88,null,1434675223,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Regarding Remy and Borini , I believe both can play out wide.So , If we are going for Remy(and Bony) , then Borini will most likely leave for Sunderland. We will definitely get decent money for him and  have to balance the squad. 

Regarding the wide players for 4-3-3 , Lallana/Sterling/Markovic/Coutinho/(Suso/Teixeira/Ibe). Sturridge can move out wide if Lambert takes up the CF position. 

(Just my opinion)Not sure about Teixeira over Suso but between Teixeira(21) and Ibe(18) , Ibe is still young and loan would definitely benefit him . Instead of spending time on bench/playing for reserves , he can be loaned out for a Championship club to gain experience. And end of  last season , BR was happy to play Teixeira ahead of Alberto.

Consider having a look on www.police.uk and compare the estate you're buying into with another area you can calibrate to. Also, get in writing from the vendor whether there have been any issues with the immediate neighbours. Write to the housing association who run the houses and ask if there are any outstanding issues - they won't give names buy might give general details.

Speak to the neighbours; introduce yourself as someone looking to move into the area, and ask if they have any thoughts on the area.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"&gt;MPs have been underpaid since the 80s when Margaret Thatcher was in power. She refused to raise the salaries of MPs because she thought it would make her look out of touch with the people who were struggling.

Would you argue the opposite? Honestly I think this has the seeds of a good idea. Force MPs to live the lifestyle of ordinary people.

Having said that, let's look at the main point.

Wikipedia states that the starting wage for an MP is £65,708 per annum as of 2010. So already this is triple the average wage and then some. [source] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaries_of_Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament#Basic_salary) and in addition whips, cabinet members and select committee members get supplementary wages of varying quantities, right up to the PM who earns over a hundred grand a year.

No, I'm sorry. You can't argue that these wages are ""low"" especially not when as stated before, there are plenty of MPs with second jobs that there is zero indication they'd give up unless forced to. 

I think that if we're going to talk pay then we need to talk performance. How happy are people with Government at the moment? Do they believe the Government is worthy of a pay rise? Is this really the right time to talk about such things given how many teachers, nurses, cops, army personnel and civil servants have lost their jobs or suffered pay freezes in recent years?

Simply saying ""they're underpaid"" is horseshit. The Government has actively refused to put into law the living wage which is meant to be paid to people who are ACTUALLY underpaid. Even at the lowliest level of MP, you can expect your wage to rise by about a grand a year regardless of inflation [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaries_of_Members_of_the_United_Kingdom_Parliament#History_of_changes_to_salary_and_expenses_rules) and you can expect hefty support from the expenses system too. I do not see how these people are in any way suffering.

Any talk of wage rise requires consequences. For a starter I would propose removing the expenses system since that was the initial compromise. Then there would need to be binding contractual obligations that the MP would not seek additional payment from any other source of employment while in office. THEN we'd need to find a way to stop retired MPs working for corporations to stop trying to influence their friends still in Parliament on behalf of those corporations.



&gt;We pay headteachers a large amount because a good headteacher can be hugely beneficial for a school, in how its run and managed, and help the children there achieve the most out of their time there. There isn't actually any requirement for a headteacher to have a teaching qualification, and many people chose to leave high powered, high salary careers to become headteachers becuase their skills are highly sought-after in this profession.

Doesn't matter. It's kind of an unspoken correlation that in order to be given authority over people doing a particular kind of work then you have to know what that work is about and what it requires and having experienced it yourself. The business world was and still does apply managers to positions and departments they have zero personal experience in and you end up like real-life equivalents of Dilbert with employees doing their best to dodge their manager's poorly informed or outright moronic expectations of them based on some vague promise he made to higher levels. It might be functional but only up to a point.

The workhouse offered free education and rudimentary medical care, which was not offered to the working poor outside. To compensate for this, life was made intentionally difficult and unpleasant.

I have indeed looked at policing reports and with exception to a period between december 2010-novemeber 2011 where their were continuously at least 9 crimes a month reported on the street (all relating to theft, fraud etc - suddenly stopped in december 2012 so I would assume a bad egg, but I have known people with mortgages to be involved in crime). Now there is just a few cases of antisocial behaviour every few months near to where we are purchasing that seems to be located around a park - but there are also cases of antisocial behaviour in the non associated housing areas. From what I understand last month kids using a hard football to play football in the street rather than a soft one was deemed as anti social behaviour - i would consider it more stupid/kids not knowing but yeh. There are cases of theft accross the development but the area is considered 'wealthy' and does suffer from targeted travelling crime. 

We did speak to the vendor and she says its a lovely area and people don't move away from there, obviously she could be biased! We have been over a few times, on a friday night as well, to hear for noise and its very quite but we will check a few more times.

Thank you for your idea on contacting the housing association, i will do that. I have read online that some prefer housing association neighbours as if their is any problems it can be dealt with quite quickly as any issues normally go against their rules.

We played a different system, Baines and the left winger had a different job to do, and Pienaar has been destroyed by injuries since then. He is a different player in a different system- and whilst he was a vital asset back then, that was a long time ago in football terms. 

&gt;I think we clearly need a player who looks to pass first before taking a shot.

We also need a player who has the capability of playing a killer pass or scoring a goal- because your attack becomes predictable if your AML has no creativity or attacking forethought. Having a player with the attacking attributes of a traditional left back makes our game easy to defend against.

&gt;keeps possession and the attack going, and doesn't waste it is crucial to victory

Scoring goals and creating chances is also, and it is not like Pienaar was great at keeping possession. His pass completion was about the same as Mirallas, his dribbling stats were not hugely different either.

Mirallas gets blamed for being wasteful, but at least he has a positive effect on our play.

&gt; Attacking Midfield areas: Adama Traore (loan) as a Europe and impact player looks to be coming, which is great... But in terms of buying... I think.. we... brace yourself... we should buy Moses. He is young, he performed amazingly under Martinez in the past, and he is hugely out of favor at Chelsea, so we should be able to get him cheap. He was vilified at Liverpool, but fuck them- he didn't fit their system, but he would fit ours. Someone like Kalou would be good also, he could be a real player for us... But I don't know about his attitude, he would compliment Coleman so well on the right, freeing Kev up to move into the middle or on the left.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;Would you argue the opposite? Honestly I think this has the seeds of a good idea. Force MPs to live the lifestyle of ordinary people.

There's no such thing as an ordinary person. Is a doctor ordinary? a head teacher? What you mean is pay them less than their worth because you don't like politicians. A regional manager for a retail business earns around £60-70,000, but you think someone who manages an actual region of a country isn't worth that? 

&gt;Wikipedia states that the starting wage for an MP is £65,708 per annum as of 2010. So already this is triple the average wage and then some

The average wage is meaningless, there are millions of people earning minimum wage in this country. No-one wants an MP who earns minimum wage. 

&gt;right up to the PM who earns over a hundred grand a year

Again, how much does a CEO of a major corporation earn? A lot more than £100,000.

One of the problems with your argument is that you think MPs have an easy job, and that once they become an MP they are part of the establishment, so anything goes, make them work 22 hours a day for minimum wage then fire them if they complain. Anyone can stand as an MP, anyone can start a political party, and it's important that the job be able to sustain a family, and attract the best kind of talent. If you make all MPs work for minimum wage or similar, no-one is going to want to do the job if they have a family to support. Despite what you might think, it is very hard work being an MP. Only the people who are already very rich will be able to afford to do the job. 

&gt;How happy are people with Government at the moment? Do they believe the Government is worthy of a pay rise? 

Can you tell me a single time in history when the majority of people have been happy with their government? People complain about the bad but ignore the good. People will never be happy with their government, but that doesn't always mean they are always doing a bad job.

&gt;Is this really the right time to talk about such things given how many teachers, nurses, cops, army personnel and civil servants have lost their jobs or suffered pay freezes in recent years?

It is a good time if we want to reform the system. Pay MPs £100,000 per year, but tighten up the expenses system and we will save money, and MPs overall will be getting less. 

&gt; I do not see how these people are in any way suffering.

Nobody, anywhere has ever said that MPs are suffering. The system of deciding how to pay MPs is broken as i mentioned above, and if we want to reform it we need to accept that MPs have been underpaid and using expenses to top up their income. 

&gt;Any talk of wage rise requires consequences. For a starter I would propose removing the expenses system since that was the initial compromise. Then there would need to be binding contractual obligations that the MP would not seek additional payment from any other source of employment while in office. THEN we'd need to find a way to stop retired MPs working for corporations to stop trying to influence their friends still in Parliament on behalf of those corporations.

I agree. The reason these problems exist in the first place is that we do not pay our MPs fairly. 

&gt;It's kind of an unspoken correlation that in order to be given authority over people doing a particular kind of work then you have to know what that work is about and what it requires and having experienced it yourself. 

There are thousands of advisers and members of staff in government that do just that. But the MP is the democratically elected representative who makes decisions based on that advice.

The ultimate goal is to save for a deposit on a flat - I would like to be in a position to buy within the next 2 years or so.

I am not in any urgency to buy anything, thus I'd rather any money I do have be doing something for me rather than sitting in a current account earning virtually bugger all.

We either accept being told what's what through being continuously outvoted undermining our actual voice within Brussels or we leave. Either way there are going to be negatives. The question is will it be easier to turn those negatives into positives long term inside an EU regime hell bent on one way of unity or outside the EU where we do what's in our best interests? I think outside the EU we will recover better so whilst there will be a short term hit in the long run it will be better. 

The sad thing is there are many Brits who agree with this guy yet due to the EU being unwilling to renegotiate they've turned to UKIP to vote to get us out. 

Let me ask you something, why should we stay in a group where our voice is constantly undermined to the point were democracy actually goes out of the window?

The EU doesn't want to change free movements as it regards it as the main point of the EU and is quite right about it. Why? Just think. Limiting free movement in the EU, because a certain country is poorer than the other simply leads to further divisions, rather than unification and REDUCING of borders within. If something, I would urge the EU to have special funds, which would help countries, which receive highest EU migrants to adapt - wouldn't that make more sense?

&gt;If I were to go out with a group of friends and we voted to have drinks and they all voted to drink wine and I voted to drink whisky then I had to drink wine all night due to being outvoted by the majority why should I stay part of that friendship group where my choice/view is being disregarded in favour of the majority group?

It is VERY often there is the peer pressure, as in, when you go out with your dudes, would you dare telling them you don't want to drink?

true,alexbate,Robinson,Robinson,"&gt;On that note, how exactly does the UK grading system work? In the US, most classes are curved (a certain percent of students get A's, B's, C's, etc). Is that the case at Cambridge, or could everyone in a given class get a first?

It can depend on the subject, but generally its a curve with (approximate) fixed percentages for each grade.

&gt;How does drinking/social life work in the UK? In the United States, we have parties with beer pong, red cups, and the like. Do these parties not exist in the UK because everyone can legally drink?

From my experience, some people still have these kind of parties occasionally (say on someone's birthday), however generally people just head to the pub, or the college bar. Also, I'm afraid beer pong isn't really a thing here.

&gt;How often do undergraduates go into London for fun?

Not that often, really, you'll be busy during term time! That being said I went a couple of times in May Week, and its very easy (train takes about 50 minutes) if you want to go and sightsee. Most British people have been to London before so its not much of a novelty. In fact those who come to Cambridge by train likely transfer through London.

&gt;I'm still a bit confused on how formal hall works. Does it exist every night, and you just go when you so choose? Or is it only for specified occasions?

How often it happens depends on the college (I believe John's have one virtually every day), but people tend to go to celebrate something, such as a birthday or the end of term. Every college will do them at least once a week. Expect 'superhalls' for special occasions, Christmas, Halloween and the like.

The UK government doesn't do that domestically. People don't claim Parliament is undemocratic or broken because Cameron and the Tories don't constantly try to appease the views of Labour or the Greens, who are in minority in Parliament.

First, figure out whether you actually owe them that money. If all your bills have been estimated, check your meter readings; maybe they're off.

It behooves you to get on their good side (or rather, to not get on their wrong side) anyway.

Second, figure out whether you're going to be able to afford the higher long-term rate. Not the 112 a month that is (AIUI) paying off the debt, but whatever the new estimate future energy usage is. If you can't afford it, you're in trouble; find a way to reduce that.

Third, figure out if you can afford to pay the 112 a month until you've cancelled the debt. Also figure out what interest is being charged; it might be beneficial to borrow off a relative and pay it upfront (and then again, it might not). If you can't afford to pay it off at that rate, it's possible you can talk to them (again, politely and patiently) to split it out even further.

It was arguably correct for a manual labourer in the 19th century, though a bit insensitive when said by someone who had never grubbed up a turnip from a frozen field with his bare hands. 

It won't fly now though. As we saw from the link above, it's only true for unskilled work, and unskilled work is on the way out. It will never go away entirely, but supply will exceed demand, so it won't pay a living wage.

I imagine that if you asked people voting in 1975 they would have told you that they knew what they were voting for, but equally I imagine the same would happen if there was a new referendum. But public understanding of the EU is probably at least as bad now as it was of the EEC in 1975.

According to the directive, member states will have to store citizens' telecommunications data for a minimum of 6 months and at most 24 months. Under the directive the police and security agencies will be able to request access to details such as IP address and time of use of every email, phone call and text message sent or received. A permission to access the information will be granted only by a court. On 8 April 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared the Directive invalid in response to a case brought by Digital Rights Ireland against the Irish authorities and others.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"I follow all our youth players on loan, and forums are the best way to do so. I still have a few accounts on boards where our lads have been out on loan too, and have been to a fair few games to see them play, and have even made acquaintances at some of these clubs, so go to games even to this day (met up with some lads last season in Blackpool that I only know because I met up with them in a pub when Seamus was out there).



I have also been following Duffy (and the others) for years in the youth setup and back when he was on loan to scunny I followed him, and opinions of him there. 

The fact is I am first and foremost an Everton fan above anything else, and I dedicate a considerable amount of time and money to following the team, and the players that we have. I no longer have a season ticket due to moving away from Merseyside, but still spend my money on away games and supporting the blues whenever I can.


Yes, keeping track of players is an involved pastime, but I spend a hell of a lot less time doing it than people I know spend playing Football Manager.

&gt; for an Everton player who you don't think will make it?

The reason I don't think he will make it is *because* I have spent time following him. It is not like I saw some kid we signed from obscurity in Ireland and thought 'fuck, this kid aint going to make it- better keep track of this hypetrain so I can shit on it whenever he is brought up'. I saw him in the youth side, and when he started going out to other clubs I wanted to track his development because I love the team and love the sport. FWIW there are players I think will make it in the youth side at the moment. I have spoken of my admiration for Kenny in this thread, who I can see being huge- but I have been super wrong in the past. I remember commenting to a friend that Vidarsson would be the perfect replacement for Cahill... Ah well, win some-lose some.  

I find it immensely rewarding watching players like Barkley start out as raw diamonds and be crafted into top players with the mix of adversity and quality playing time at other clubs. Yes, this is a stupidly involved level of support, and I know that- but player development is an aspect of the game I find genuinely fascinating. 

I am like the obsessive Game Of Thrones fan who reads all the prequel fan fiction, except the fan fiction is all real in this case. 

Apologies if I was rude. I enjoy taking the piss a bit too much at times- and people using stats as their sole evidence in football discussions really grinds my gears, because unless you are discussing very specific parts of play, they will never give anywhere near a picture of a player or a team.

I think that's certainly ended up hurting them; it doesn't matter how much they argue the point that they didn't have an overall majority and couldn't do what they liked, they'd made a fairly clear pledge to vote against raises - and then did.

&gt; How about their failure to deliver change to the election system with the humiliating two-to-one loss of the 2011 referendum on the Alternative Vote? 

Don't think it's really their fault - they delivered the referendum, it wasn't them that led the god-awful campaign in favour, and they probably didn't expect such a brutally effective No campaign either.

&gt; Or was it the very moment they entered into coalition with the Conservatives?

My recollection is not of wild protests at the time, it was seen as a mature piece of politicking to form the only possible stable coalition given the results of the election.

I think *any* coalition would likely have hurt the Lib Dems, as no matter what they did it would alienate some of their voters - having been an opposition party since before the Second World War, it's relatively easy to attract those disaffected with either of the major parties.  Fairly obviously for example they will have support from voters who identify with the ""Orange Book"" type policies; a very social-democrat coalition with Labour could equally well have alienated those voters.",0,1405167203,null,0,false,0,civd142,t3_2ah76x,t1_civd142,t3_2ah76x,null,1434678770,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3

City = sky blue. We arent going for colors with stipulations sewn into the sleeves, white f'n trim. We are cornering the market on one color...sky f'n blue. We are buying clubs in other countries and introducing what color? Thats right bob, sky f'n blue. We own the name city and we own the color....sky blue. 

Coventry city? Are you kidding? A kid in asia will know who coventry city is? A kid in africa? America? Any other nation that starts with an a? On an international scale, no one has a clue who coventry city is. And we arent being mistaken for other clubs bc guess what...we have the unifying color...sky blue. You bring up man united having one color home shorts....NOPE. theyve used black and white within the past few years. Guess what they are known for? Yep, a single color...red.  

From a marketing stand point we need the flexibility to change secondary colors otherwise we have the same boring jersey every single year. Navy black white. It doesnt matter bc we have moved into owning anything and everything that ever touches sky blue. Its a much much much more powerful branding aspect than owning anything that has sky blue as long as it has white trim. Do you not understand that? 

Its a selling point that made shiek buy us.  He was pitched that anything with the city name or the city color would be owned and branded by us.

Sturridge is easily better than Soldado right now, I can't see how anyone could argue that. Soldado could still come good but is older and seems to be struggling to adjust to the prem and had a very poor goal scoring rate from open play. Sturridge is scoring for fun at Liverpool.

Lambert and Ade are more similar and I don't think one is particulary better than the other imo. Obviously in his prime Ade was lethal but he's been inconsistent as he ages and Lambert has looked good for Southampton the last few years getting a decent goal return each season.

Then Borini and Kane again is an easy choice to me, Borini hasn't been prolific but he's a solid player who can get better whereas Kane is younger and further behind in terms of progression as a result imo.

That's what matters. Some lenders will not accept someone working past state retirement age.

I always look at these type of applications with a degree of scepticism because the attitude from people applying for mortgages is always one of ""This will do for now I'll sort it out later"" and the new regulatory atmosphere is one where customers should not be trusted and everything must be evidenced.

The vast, vast majority of applications that I decline are following a marital breakup and generally people in those circumstances (who of course I sympathise with) and they place much higher value in maintaining their current situation than they do on properly adjusting to being able to have less.

Newspaper articles are difficult for this type of thing because banks can't respond or comment, so it's all down to how the customer misrepresents why the bank denied them the loan they feel entitled to.

I'd far sooner tell someone to buy a cheaper house in a not so nice area rather than commit themselves at 40 to work to 75. However I'll still go with what a customer wants if they're absolutely sure and fully understand what they're getting themselves into.

The questions at the heart of things is this : Can customers be trusted to make long term decisions themselves, or will they make bad short term decisions? Who are banks to tell people how to live their lives? If people want to make a mistake then it's their choice.

The FCAs MMR concluded that banks need to be responsible and customers can't be trusted to be adults, so that's the regulatory environment we're in now.",0,1405167982,null,0,false,0,civd6qq,t3_2afz0e,t1_civd6qq,t3_2afz0e,null,1434678848,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The public demands that the poor, vulnerable, the rich, and anyone else who isn't them is kicked. The government deliver with empty rhetoric against the rich, and a crack down on being poor with ATOS and social engineering.

On the other side we have people with an overdeveloped sense of entitlement. Students doing pointless mickey mouse degrees and expecting a 50K job waiting at the end of it.

So we've all turned on ourselves and we're trying to force everybody else to do the shit jobs that are beneath us.

And then people learned that German socialists used the swastika symbol to represent crossed ""S"" letters for their ""socialist"" dogma (another discovery by the historian Dr. Rex Curry). But all the Godwin's law bot could do was switch to looking for ""Hitler,"" in an effort to prevent more people from learning the truth about the symbol and about the misnomer slang ""Nazi"" (and how it has been used to cover up the socialist dogma of Hitler and his supporters).


Godwin's Law has loopholes. The loophole is to always and only use the full phrase “National Socialist German Workers’ Party” in place of the misleading abbreviation ""Nazi"" that is used almost exclusively by the general public (and by all victims of government schools (socialist schools)) due to rampant ignorance about what the abbreviation abbreviates. Most people do not know the etymology of the shorthand slang ""Nazi"" and they do not know that members of the National Socialist German Workers Party did not refer to themselves as ""Nazis."" http://rexcurry.net/godwin.html  

Note also that Godwin’s Law ceases to apply when people really act like genuine Nazis, such as by directing children daily to robotically chant en masse the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag (which was the origin of the stiff-arm salute adopted later by the National Socialist German Workers Party, as uncovered by the historian and etymologist Dr. Rex Curry, author of ""Pledge of Allegiance &amp; Swastika Secrets"") by persecuting people for exercise of free speech (e.g. by persecuting those who refuse to recite the Pledge of Allegiance).",0,1405169293,null,0,false,0,civdh0d,t3_1yeby6,t1_civdh0d,t1_civbp7z,null,1434678977,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

While you're still young, this is now time to consider seriously about your life as to how you want to live your life. If you still don't like doing law related jobs, it's time to forgot about it. Do not consider your law degree useless as it shows you're clever to employers and probably useful if they might have a question or two about legal matter while you work for them.

Skilled trade job is very good and it'll be always in demand. If you're a skilled tradesman, you'll always find a job around in your area.

Don't worry about kids, as it doesn't matter to you right now and this only adds unnecessary stress to your life if you dare to think about it. I can guarantee you that once you get a proper job, your stress will reduce and you might start thinking about kids.

And no, not all jobs are in London but obviously, a lot of jobs will be in London because there are more people living there but you don't really need to worry about it.

The 26-year-old is the Baggies' fourth signing of the summer after Joleon Lescott from Manchester City, Craig Gardner from Sunderland and most recently Chris Baird from recently-promoted Burnley.

Pocognoli has won 12 caps but missed out on a place in his country’s World Cup squad after injury saw him miss the closing weeks of the 2013-14 Bundesliga season.

He previously had spells with Genk, AZ Alkmaar and Standard Liege before joining Hannover at the start of last season.

During his time in the Netherlands, Pocognoli was part of the AZ Alkmaar side – then managed by incoming Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal – which won the 2008-9 Eredivisie title.

Coach Alan Irvine told the club's website: ""Sebastien is an experienced left-back who has played at a high level for many years.

""After being named in Belgium's provisional World Cup squad, he just missed out on Brazil, mainly because he hadn't played enough games towards the end of the season.

""But he's joined us with a real hunger to prove himself at Albion and get back into the international set-up.

""We've done our due diligence on Sebastien in terms of people who have worked with him, including Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas.

The GDL is not an easy cop-out course, you have to do the work of a three-year law degree in one year full-time studying. 

I would argue that a language degree is not irrelevant; do you not think it's advantageous for lawyers to speak foreign languages, especially if you're going into commercial or contract law, and with London the financial capital of the EU? Right now I am in France working as a legal translator, getting experience in the parallels and differences between the two systems.

I live in the north, I earn 27-32k a year and I honestly cannot see a route for me that allows me to live the way I want to live but also hit my goal which is to own my own home in its entirety.

I either have to choose to pay rent, and pay a substantial amount of my leftover income as a deposit which would result in me not having any participation in society apart from my work for the next 4-5 years or I just accept I won't ever own a home.

And if I do ever get to find a home, I can't see it being where I want it to be.

All I'm doing at the moment is focusing on raising my income.

I've played the game society has asked and it keeps pulling that rung of the ladder further out of my reach.

Whilst that's great - and I can see why it's enjoyable and attractive - what is there to do once you get older and there are too many people younger than you who are willing to work harder, longer and for less money?

Once you come back to the UK and say that you have spent 5 years teaching English in South Korea... then what?

You are earning an above-average salary in an area with a below-average cost of living.

What sort of lifestyle is it that you want to have?

&gt; I either have to choose to pay rent, and pay a substantial amount of my leftover income as a deposit which would result in me not having any participation in society apart from my work for the next 4-5 years or I just accept I won't ever own a home.

I really don't know what to say to you other than *that's just how life is*. If you want to save up a deposit for a home and get a decent mortgage that won't hamstring you when interest rates rise then yes, you will need to cut down on your social life and how much money you spend on takeaways, video games, movies and alcohol for several years in order to afford it.

I don't think you actually realise just how fucking good your situation is compared to some people. All you need to do is cut down on the social life for the next few years and save that money for your deposit instead.

true,gamermusclevideos,null,null,"- You are not defined your job  (unless you want to be)

- There is more to life than moving up the corporate ladder 

- You are not defined by the degree you took 

- Degree level education is more about establishing structured writing and thinking processes and learning how to learn about the foundation of a subject mater and then present what you learned. You should be able to take the skill you learn from one degree to any subject and learn about that subject very quickly.

- A degree holds value for things totally unrelated to that specific degree 

- Maybe you can look at self employment opportunities, web based incomes entrepreneurial activities you are already at the lowest wrung what do you have to lose ?

- Think how clever you are say you place your self in the middle just think that means 50% of people are more stupid than you and believe me there are truly stupid people doing jobs you don't want truly stupid people doing.  I find that thought can be both comforting and frightening :)

- If you are single then all you have to lose is your time and if you are spending your time trying to do something then its not lost time because you will be learning something.   

- Maybe look at charity work or find things that interest you and immerse yourself in them, go to groups and events. Even at places like a gym the beach , leisure centre supermarket talk with people.

- Don't let the job centre get you down its just a system one thats gaint and has plenty of issues. 

- If you want a generic job / cooperate type situation then you will likely have to move to where the work is. 

- If you need time to think and want to place yourself in a new environment doing a TEFL ( English as a foreign language teacher) course and then you can get a job very fast in many countries. 

- Have you thought about flat share or room shares ? that way you could do an apprenticeship and still be independent obviously it would be very tight  but as an example I lived in a room smaller than a prison cell for 8 months whilst starting one business paying £180 month rent and all bills.

Not saying things as a whole are good but there are bubbles of economic growth in the UK, I think its getting worse fast but UK still has a reasonable support structure for entrepreneurs or people on the low end trying to make it.   

I feel at 23 time is on your side :) though you might still get hit by a buss so don't take it for granted to much.

true,nomsville,english,Hertfordshire,"Mate, I know exactly where you're coming from. I'm 22 and my school life sounds almost identical to yours (although I got a music degree, which is worth even less. I got it mainly because music was the only thing I enjoyed doing). I was unemployed for a year after graduating. If you're an unemployed graduate at the job centre, they seem to think the reason you don't have a job is because you're lazy or not willing to work for anything less than a big important job. Luckily there were a couple of people in there that I'd talk to sometimes who were sympathetic, but in a way I hated sympathy and constantly felt like I was letting people down. I honestly did apply for almost any job I could (I'll admit to not applying to some jobs recommended to me by the job centre, either because it was something I knew I'd be shit at/hate, or through bad reputation). 

I feel like I was lucky to land the job I've got now. In January my other half's mum saw adverts for an open day at Arriva, I went, got to the driving stage and was told I was a great driver. I remember how amazing that made me feel, and how great it was to get a job offer a few weeks later. I had to wait 5 months for the DVLA to approve my medical (had a heart operation a couple of years ago), but I started training 2 weeks ago and I'm loving it. Sure the pay isn't amazing (it'll get better after a few years, to the point of maintaining a family), and I'm constantly asked by people who think uni is the gateway to a big job in London why didn't I do a job with my degree. But to be honest, I feel like I'd be happier here than I would doing a job that I feel wouldn't be of service to society. (Ignore me if you think I'm putting a bus driving job on a pedestal here, but a good bus driver can be a good person in a community). If there's something you enjoy doing and think you'd be good at, don't worry if it has nothing to do with your degree. If you're happy doing it why should someone else's judgement matter? I know you're probably under more pressure with a law degree, but you haven't written your life off, you've only just started.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"Engineering industries are very large in the north and require lots of staff outside the actual engineering functions of the business (Which would normally require a STEM degree). I would give that a shot. The Process industry is particularly large in the North East region and would be a good start, whilst there is also lots of available opportunities in Oil &amp; Gas that are based on-shore. It is unlikely that after completing a degree that you will get on an apprenticeship scheme (You need to be under a certain age for the company to receive government funding), but you would be very well placed for graduate/entry office based roles.

Don't put yourself down, your law degree is incredibly useful in a wide variety of different roles. You likely know how to interpret legal speak which makes you valuable in almost any function within a business that has to follow government rules and/or regulations. Finance, Project Management, HSEQ (Health, Safety, Environment, Quality), Sales/Proposals, Purchasing/Procurement, Human Resources etc. Also you could apply for roles as an analyst; for instance, the company I work for has numerous roles designed to analyse data from the MRP (Manufacturing Resource Planning) system to improve efficiency within the business, which is hugely important and can lead to £100,000s of savings. 

My advise is widen the scope of the jobs you are applying for. Contact companies directly asking if they have any entry level roles available suitable for somebody with a law degree who feels he doesn't want to practice law specifically. 

Competition is high, don't get downhearted when you receive rejections or don't get replies, just keep on trying. Searching for jobs is a case of delayed gratification, your efforts are fruitless until you receive an offer of employment which is what makes it so difficult to keep motivated. It took me a year, 300+ applications and 19 interviews to find work, and trust me I felt in a similar situation to you before.

Do you have something to do in the mean time (Whether paid, or unpaid on something in your own time?). It is always good to do something in your own time so you have something meaningful to take about in interviews. If you are currently not working part time or anything, I would advise moving back in with a family member temporarily until you get on your feet, simply for financial reasons. Even if you pay for your own food, and pay rent etc. Heating one house is cheaper than heating two.

I think this is something a lot of people are confused about. The days of living where you want to live with your first home are over and done with, if they ever existed at all (which I doubt). 

The first step on the ladder is usually either a small place where you want to live, or a bigger place where you don't want to live. That's just the way it needs to be done, I'm afraid. It's why it's called a housing ladder. You can't get to the top of the ladder without using a few of the bottom rungs. 

You get on the ladder with a less than desirable property first. Improve it as much as you can, and pay down as much of the mortgage as possible while you're living there. This brings your LTV down from the 90% you'll likely start off to something better like 80% or 70% when you come to progress to the next rung. This will open up better rates when you go to buy your next property, which will make larger or more desirable property open up within your budget. 

Eventually, you'll end up with a property you like in an area you like. It's just not going to be instant and it's going to take sacrifice. 

Honestly, £32K wage is £120K mortgage. That can buy you a place up north reasonably easy. On the outskirts of major cities that can get you a 2-3 bed house!",0,1405172756,null,0,false,0,civec9h,t3_2ai7s7,t1_civec9h,t1_civduqj,null,1434679429,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

You'll either have to bite the bullet and work somewhere where most of your wage goes on rent/bill/food or live with your parents and be able to save some more. At this stage on your life it's all about building experience, don't get too hooked up on wages and think more about building *relevant* (in what you want) experience. Find room mates, house mates etc.. 

You've got a good degree and good marks, but you're still gonna have to start out at the bottom if you really want to get somewhere half decent You've got time on your side, you're still young so make the most of it.

Unfortunately internships, short term entry level contracts etc.. are what needs to be done as graduates for most people.

The life of a student doesn't end at graduation. Most people don't get into the advertised high paying graduate jobs straight out of Uni to live the life of a baller.

Yep. If you have a LTV of more than 90% you will find it damn near impossible to remortgage and will have to just keep going with the original mortgage after its offer period has ended, which usually means a rate rise and higher monthly payments which doesn't help the situation. Trapped in a property that was only meant to be a stepping stone. It gets people down, I guess. 

In a stagnant/upwards market the ladder works as planned. Over the kind of periods we're talking for each rung (3-5 years) it really shouldn't matter as long as there isn't another 2008-esque event. The small dips can be overcome with time. 

So yeah, if you want to stay in the country and you like whereabouts you live I'd recommend getting on that first rung. 

At the end of the day, there's simply not enough houses being built and our population is set to explode. Beyond massive and extremely unpopular government intervention I really don't see the house market crashing any time soon. Stagnation could happen, if the government pull their finger out and do what needs to be done. But stagnation doesn't effect the ladder. It's probably preferable.

Replicating your previous form in new league, with new teammates, and a new tactical system is never as easy as you'd think it is based on how excited people are for these signings. I personally don't believe, despite their obvious quality, that Fab or Costa are going to be unqualified successes at Chelsea because Mourinho simply doesn't tend to get the most out of his signings. Although Costa certainly fits his system better than anyone striker he's had in a while.

The only signing I see as potentially a game changer is Sanchez to Arsenal. City are going to be where they've been. Chelsea too. Man United were not as bad as Moyes made them look and with signings they'll prove that even more so. Ultimately Arsenal were the club I worried about most. With Sanchez I'm not genuinely worried. If they don't bring in anyone else big then perhaps it's no big deal, but right now I do think we at least need to make signings that will improve our first team and first bench. It seems we are in that process.

I do not think, however, we need to sign some megastar who has already established himself at the top of some other league. I also think rumors are never a good barometer to go on about whether we'll sign someone. There are plenty of deals and players that slip through the radar.

Who gives a toss what other people think? No one expected us to be even close to top four last season but we were a win away from the league. The club aren't suddenly going to implode and finish 12th because Suarez left.

Personally, I don't think there's a chance at all that Di Maria will be playing for United at the start of the season. Although they are a massive club, they lost a lot of their attractiveness to players when Sir Alex retired and in this season in particular, failed to qualify for the Champions League.

Chelsea and Man City strengthening shouldn't really worry us as much as it is for some of the people on this subreddit. They had a stronger squad than us last season and they will continue to have a stronger squad this season.

Although a lot of us seem to forget this, we are still in the building process. If Brendan can bring the club to a stable 'top 4' level like we were previously then we will be able to attract bigger players much like what Arsenal have just done recently with Sánchez.

Trust in Brendan and his new signings/squad and I'm sure we'll be fine.

Of course it will be a tough fight for top four, same as every year, but we have a strong squad with a good mentality and great chemistry, which imo is more important than star names, and one of the best young managers in the business.

Besides that, we have brought in two of the best performers that we reasonably could have from the Premier League last season plus are linked with or have signed highly rated youngsters who will be ambitious and desperate to make an impact. I expect the Moreno deal is far from dead, and Shaqiri might even be considered surplus to requirements considering we have signed one winger in Lallana and look like getting another in Markovic, plus our current stock of Sterling, Ibe, Borini etc. who are either natural wingers or can play there. We need a LB and are looking at some good options in my opinion, and a CB probably and we are looking to sign players in both of those positions.

TL;DR Relax, they won't see us coming till it's too late. We don't need the fanfare of marquee signings and media hype, we just need the talent we have and a little extra, plus Rodgers' tactical brilliance and we can take them all by surprise again.

This is a problem I have with modern interpretations of what happened during the Louis XIV problem. Which was pan-european. 

Irish people who supported James, supported the Jacobite movement. That was closely associated with and supported Louis the Sun King. 

People who supported William were backed either by direct funding or the fact that the Vatican just did not support James or Louis. Both Pope Innocent and Pope Alexander were not pleased by the way in which the Jacobites were trying to re-catholicise Britain. In fact, it was the religions zeal of James that started the whole thing. Some even argue (disputable) that the Vatican funded Williams war against James. 

If James had succeeded in keeping the British crown and beat William, instead of fleeing to Ireland at the first sign of trouble and bringing the war to Ireland, then he would have helped Loius take one more piece of land in his crazy sociopathic autocratic move to make his own kingdom in western Europe. 

The Vatican were against James and Louis and for William. How is that a sectarian traditon? Unless you are a supporter of James. Both true catholics and true protestants should both be pleased about William winning the war. Just history seems to elude us. 

Its sectarian now. But I think people need to read a bit more.

true,Cyridius,irish,Ireland,"&gt;That is why I said 27 and not 28, did you miss that?

No, I ignored it because it's the most moronic part of your argument and I was giving you a chance to gracefully forget it.

In your little world, is the person you vote for the only democratically representative individual in the UK parliament? You know, the entire world doesn't exist to represent *you*.

&gt;Secondly, the cabinet in the UK doesn't require someone to be a directly elected MP yes, however minus a few very specific cases in the past they always have been. Just look at the current cabinet.

So? Cameron could still have done it and nobody would have been able to do anything about it. In fact the Commission is chosen with the European Parliament and Council's cooperation, there's far more in the EU that can be done to prevent such a Commission than can be done in the UK.

&gt;Nobody in the UK would accept a cabinet without any MPs so why accept it in Europe without MEPs?

You have absolutely no choice but to accept it. Your MPs would be forced to do a vote of no confidence if they didn't like what would happen, and that's entirely optional. There are fewer checks and balances in the UK than there are in the EU. Just in the EU's case it's more technocratic in its operation at the Executive level because there is an abundance of democratic representation in the Council and the Parliament, both of which have their own Presidencies, and the latter of which has an abundance of committees made of representatives from all across Europe in order to tackle the various legislative issues in the EU.",0,1405175386,null,0,false,0,civf46l,t3_2ai0pq,t1_civf46l,t1_civf0rm,null,1434679889,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I'd got my 2.2 in Biosciences (an underachievement,  but my own fault) and I started my teacher training course, just like I'd planned. 3 months in I decided it wasn't for me. Typically I'm not a quitter - took a lot of thought to move on.

I'd been working part time at Argos throughout my uni days, so I stayed on part time picking up a few extra hours here and there. With no great plans, I conceded myself to the Argos retail management programme. Only a few weeks later, I found my application was unsuccessful.

This was hard to take. I grew up in the industrial centre of the West Midlands as a bright spark. Always top of the class as a youngster, I'd somehow ended up with a mediocre degree and unable to get into a retail management position. It felt bad.

I put my CV out there, applied for graduate training programmes, and got nowhere. They were competitive, and wanted 2.1 or higher for the most part. Then one day I was contacted by an IT company in need of software consultants. They wanted graduates of any discipline, just because the role required a bit of project and time management. It felt great to know I'd been contacted based on my CV, for a job I'd never have considered if spotting it on a job site.

I got the job 6 years ago, started on 18k. I moved to another company in January this year, and now earn 40k doing the same type of work, all off the back of that initial call. So my advice is to get yout CV to look as good as possible, get it out there and update it every couple of months (even if there are no changes, you will get more hits depending on how recent the CV is) - something will come along.

So yes, I made an assumption and lumped you in with the masses, but you have yet to see Markovic in a red shirt.  Sure, Benfica churn out talented players, but we've seen how Rodgers can cultivate real talent.

I bet last season many would have said Griezmann would be a better talent than Sterling, and now that isn't so clear.

It comes down to this: I hate people writing off the players we're signing that Rodgers obviously covets.  There were many writing off Allen, Sturridge and Sakho at various points when their names were announced as targets.  Give them time before you say who's a better young talent.

The same thing goes for Bony as many were hoping we'd steal him last season.

true,pylori,cnty-england,East Midlands,"as a graduate medic myself, i think people should be cautious about jumping into this. for the same reason as the OP feels about law and being pushed into it, medicine isn't for everyone. if it's not want you really want to do, i think it's best to stay out of it. it's very tough, and expensive especially because it's not known yet, due to budget cuts, whether the same level of government support will pay for future graduate medics as they have done before (4x£9000 isn't as nice on the pockets as 1x£3500).

the pay may be decent later on, but if money is what interests you there are far easier ways to earn more money. it's a gruelling and emotionally draining job, and if your heart isn't in it all the way, you may not just hurt yourself, but staff as well as patients.

i don't want to seem like a downer in a thread where the OP already feels bad, but these courses are extremely competitive, far more than undergraduate medical courses, and the last thing you want is to sink in so much effort, time, and money, only to realise that you don't enjoy it when you've just spent 80 hours of your week on the wards and only have a day off before you have to head back.",0,1405176990,null,0,false,0,civfn58,t3_2ai7s7,t1_civfn58,t1_civdh2l,null,1434680117,46,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,46

You can go through every question in a particular section by going to the 'practice' bit. e.g. All of the road-sign questions.

The app's ""mock test"" doesn't do any of the case study questions, but those are easy. ""James starts to skid whilst accellerating. Should he: a) Ease off the throttle... b) Rag it like a mad bastard...""

The Hazard Perception test is a crock of shit. It's not good enough to just anticipate a hazard just like you would on the road. You need to click every time the hazard changes. The actual videos are usually obvious - a horse popping out of a side road, some kids running near a crossing e.t.c. Just click when you spot it, and click every time it gets worse. Then click a few more times whilst it's happening. If you do that, you'll pass easily.

Don't click-spam throughout the whole thing, or click in patterns, otherwise you will fail. I followed my above strategy and got 65/75 (pass mark is 44 iirc).",0,1405177512,null,0,false,0,civftdf,t3_2ac8cw,t1_civftdf,t3_2ac8cw,null,1434680158,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1

As far as navy goes, wasn't navy part of the trim color for the last 2 seasons as well? And others? I thought this was pretty typical. Always thought of it as their secondary color.

Also, I'd be pretty upset if I was buying a different kit ever year and ended up buying pretty much the same white shorts year after year after year. 120+ years one would hope for some variance from time to time. Unless they come out and say that the white shorts are forever gone, I do not see the need for a petition or rant for one season. Then again, I'm American...

I am from the uk, I'm 22 and I studied music at university. I felt pretty much the same as you when I finished uni last year. I was so fed up of feelin like I had nowhere to go and all my qualifications were meaningless. So I follows my gut and found a wy to get out and start a new slate. I went to Switzerland and the plan was to say there as an au pair for a year and figure out wht I wanted to do.  I love it so much here that I left my au pair job, found somewhere to live with friends here and now have a job at a garden centre (nothing to do with music!)

I met the love of my life here, learnt german and have completely new dreams to start a survival camp in South America. I'm going to Italy next week with people I met out here. 

And if this doesn't work out, I can go back to uk and have much more life experience now after just one year.

I come from a working class family and thy were never able to help me with finances. I realised that you don't need money to have a good life. I live with what I have and hangs job if I don't like it. Yes it's not a career but I still don't know if I want a career.

Yes, clearly.  However, for Baines to perform at his highest level, he needs link play, and someone with some defensive capability to cover when he goes forward.  Look at how terrible he looked for England with Rooney in front of him.

&gt;We also need a player who has the capability of playing a killer pass or scoring a goal

So does everyone.  How much cash do you have in your wallet?
Besides, the amount of interchange that goes on in the three attacking midfield positions is significant.  Everybody floats, and that's what makes it unpredictable.  If we could pick up someone who has a playing style similar to Ozil, (cheaper, obviously) I think that's the sort of player we want.  Links up well, understands the basics of defense, floats around overloading defenders.

&gt;Mirallas gets blamed for being wasteful

Don't get me wrong, I love Mirallas, and he's often beautiful to watch play, but he is frequently wasteful.  Maybe after another year under Martinez, he'll learn better when the shot isn't on.  He does have some defensive capabilities, though.

edit: Found the full document from the BFI [here](http://www.bfi.org.uk/sites/bfi.org.uk/files/downloads/bfi-film-fund-diversity-guidelines-for-production-2014-07.pdf). It seems largely aimed at increasing diversity off screen rather than in the films themselves. Films need two ticks to be funded and if you look at the section on what criteria can be fulfilled to be awarded a tick (page 4) it seems primarily aimed at the production crew. I highly doubt any film company is going to change a film's plot or characters to get funding when they could easily just ensure the crew are moderately diverse...

edit 2: Okay, so looking through the document a little more closely it seems that every single one of the criteria can be fulfilled by having someone from a 'socially disadvantaged background'. It doesn't go on to specify exactly what is meant by that term but it gives the example of 'individuals who or whose parents and family live below the national average wage; or whose parents were not university educated, or who were given free school meals'. This seems purposefully vague and non-specific to me, it looks as though they're making it pretty easy to pass.",0,1405178875,null,0,1405180151,0,civgb3b,t3_2aiif6,t1_civgb3b,t3_2aiif6,null,1435473208,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"&gt; Don't get me wrong, I love Mirallas, and he's often beautiful to watch play, but he is frequently wasteful. Maybe after another year under Martinez, he'll learn better when the shot isn't on. He does have some defensive capabilities, though.

That is the point though, his dribbling stats are not that much different to Pienaar's (one extra per game on average I think), his passing is about equal and his shooting is way, way more efficient. In addition to this his crossing is hugely better and he is making twice as many chances, not to mention the fact he scored a very reasonable number of goals once he got more settled into the system. 

There seems to be a bit of a confirmation bias going on with people and slating Mirallas for being wasteful, but not Pienaar. Yes, Pienaar's waste is less dramatic- but if you watch him, he loses possession time and time again, and it is usually in simple passages of play.

Mary is more wasteful that I would like, but at least he is making a difference, which Pienaar isn't- despite his wastefulness. ",0,1405178888,null,0,false,0,civgb9v,t3_2agkds,t1_civgb9v,t1_civg5i0,null,1435473210,2,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,2

I did well in my GCSEs I got to college and began to question the whole education system. It seemed to just be a production line to me. I couldn't see any great value in it at that point. However, at this stage of my life I didn't have the balls to get off the conveyor belt. Maybe as a result of this thinking I didn't do great in my A Levels. 

I went to Uni and studied what I had been good at (Computer Science) but still was deeply unhappy. There was something so unsatisfying about the whole thing to me. And so this time I quit. I went back home and I got a job working in a school. Just over a year of this and I realise there is nowhere for me to go from here. I would have been doing that job forever and my life was already one big routine just working towards payday after payday. 

I thought maybe I would gie uni another shot but this time in a subject I was interested in (psychology). I have to say this time round things have gone better. I'm now also 23 and will be graduating with a 1st on Thursday. 

Despite enjoying myself and doing well I still have this feeling of dissatisfaction with the whole system. I mean on one of my essays I once got the feedback ""This is good but next time just do it the way you were told to."" What is that? I feel education has become too much about just cramming knowledge into people and not enough about equipping them to use or gather knowledge themselves. There is a focus on the what to think and not the how. 

So right now I have three plans. I carry on just playing the game and doing what my parents expect me to do... I go get some more work experience, then get onto the doctorate I want to do and end up with a well paid and respectable job that I am not content with. Plan two which I am experimenting with at the moment is to set up my own publishing company. I love reading and writing and I want to enable others to read and write too. Or the third plan which is what my heart really wants. I pack my bags and I fly to another country and I just do odd jobs and bar work and then I move on. But I meet people and I connect with people and I really truly live life. 

I went to an open mic night the other week and someone read one of their poems. They talked about the gap between how we live our life and how we wish we lived it. I think I want to close that gap.

I also heard someone else say the other day that life isn't about holding down a job, or at least it shouldn't be. 

I really hope I muster the courage to just stay ""Stop this shit I'm getting off."" I know I am not happy being part of this big machine but it takes balls to walk away from it. I'm still trying to find the balls to do it.

You might not realise this my American friend, but we're not the only team in Europe to wear sky blue.

Napoli and Lazio for example are two of the most high profile teams in Europe (Lazio at least used to be) and they wear sky blue.

We don't 'own' sky blue, are you daft?

We do have traditional colours though, a traditional kit which is identifiably Manchester City.

This is the point, we should insist kit manufacturers respect this, and not doing so undermines our heritage.

Also, I don't know why I'm bothering to explain this to you as you clearly don't get it. Manchester United are not the only team to wear red, their biggest rivalry besides us is with Liverpool, who also wear red - but no-one besides apparently yourself would mistake the two basic templates of their kit for one another.

You can't trivialise this topic.

Well maybe you can, since you can't grasp subtleties.

This season is the first in our history our home kit has contained no white whatsoever since 1895, and that was for one single year before we'd established our club colours. That is a big deal from a tradition perspective and a 'branding' perspective.

Should we be applauding Nike for totally disregarding our heritage and traditional colours?

As for pie analogies, you clearly don't get it. Tedious discussion.

So try and work out what *you* want to do, and then go out and do it really well. People who manage that always do well. If you're not sure what to do then take the advice of other commenters here and travel for a bit. 

There is nothing like travelling to put life into perspective and inspire new ideas.

It sounds to me like you're super surprised that life hasn't got awesome yet. Perhaps we all feel like that for a short while when the reality of being grown up hits us. 

Seriously though if you are genuinely wondering if life is worth it - seek professional help. Your GP, samaritans, counselling are all available.

You probably feel average because you are / have been surrounded by people just like you. You've probably forgotten how unique you are. In the grand scheme of things you're in the top 5% of the world.

Young, healthy, educated western male. You realise all the odds of you being that fortunate! A lot has had to come together to make that kinda potential - use it! Perhaps some travel would help you to get an idea of what others have &amp; do not have. Don't feel bad, use what you have! 

What job do you actually want? Not for the rest of your life but for a short time. No one will tell you what industry to get into. 

If you want more than a job at Tescos (nothing wrong with that if you want an easy life) then it's up to YOU to find it, make it &amp; push yourself. Don't just accept what jobs are listed in the papers. 

There's no curriculum or 'right answer' now - we're all just figuring it out. 

If there's anything I can do to personally help - let me know.

&gt;So by your logic if the EU decide to legalise rape and the majority vote to legalise it then we should just accept that as well because that's democracy and we are the minority? Fuck off. Don't be so stupid.

i'm not arguing that we should do everything the EU says without question, i'm saying that david cameron is going through these negotiations with the tact of a toddler. Do you know what compromise is? its not just submitting to everything, its picking what you really want or need and trying to be reasonable about it, wanting rape legal is clearly not reasonable, if they thought it was then i'd be on your side. and for what the EU are wanting a large number (i don't know if its a majority or not) of people in the UK are happy with, its not like its for issues that are completely opposed here (like rape or trafficking which would be).

* Apply now for every job (Autofill is a godsend) and save a copy of each (customised) CV / Cover letter in a folder on your computer with the name of that company.

6: That's a debatable assertion. It is in my lifetime, but my father would debate it.

true,SimoneDeBroccolah,null,null,"Ok, so this might be a long one, as I've just delivered some training about this topic, so feel fairly knowledgeable. So foetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a range of conditions that result from maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. 

Foetal alcohol syndrome specifically is diagnosed when there is CONFIRMED maternal alcohol use during pregnancy, facial features, growth deficiency and central nervous system dysfunction.

The facial characteristics include quite thin upper lips and a flat philtrum. The growth deficiency is basically small heads, low weight and short stature. The central nervous dysfunction refers to the way the brain develops (basically not like typically developing brains, particularly in the frontal lobe). It can lead to learning, attention, memory etc issues and some language difficulties (relatively good speech/expressive language, but poorer understanding) and difficulties understanding abstract concepts. Obviously every individual is different. They are also often very likeable and VERY determined/committed.

Other conditions in the spectrum include foetal alcohol effects (no physical  characteristics, but have the rest) and alcohol related birth defects (physical characteristics, but not the central nervous system dysfunction). Like most disorders, there's a full spectrum, and some people are less effected than others. The only time you would get a diagnosis without CONFIRMED maternal drinking would be for children in care whose background is completely unknown. 

We don't know how many kids are effected in the uk, but it's probably a relatively high number (vs other conditions). Also, more alcohol = more chance &amp; more severe, but it isn't guaranteed.

The issue is that it is simply not possible, with the ridiculous current regulatory situation, to build the massive numbers of cheaper properties that Britain requires at present time.  The fact is, Britain is a wealthy country.  Lots of people here have money.  Do you not think that if it were possible to build houses and sell them at profit, people would do so?  Hell, I'd start a fucking building company myself.  

But it frankly is almost impossible to start major new developments these days.  In the rare occasion that you do get permission, you might as well make them £1m+ luxury flats since that's the only way you're going to survive.  

The *only* thing that will stop the crisis is the smashing of NIMBYism totally and completely across the UK, the destruction (sorry) of the green belt around London, the removal of most Line-of-Sight requirements in major cities, and a massive increase in government support for construction workers.

The other youngster of the first half Mccalumm did pretty much nothing all half, don't really remember him touching the ball. Cresswell made a few mistakes and wasn't great, but saw some glimpses of what he could bring to the team, and Poyet didn't really do anything good or bad. Tatics-wise, we played the same sort of formation as last year, 4-2-3-1, but we played very wide with the O'brien and cresswell pushing up a lot, and noble dropping back to cover, almost as if we were playing 5 at the back with 2 wing backs. Hardly any long balls, though. This didn't really work, as vaz te, nolan and morrison all played quite central and it would just become congested, and when stevenage got the ball back the defence seemed out of position (particulary Chambers) and gave stevenage a lot of space, who looked more threatening all half. However, their first goal was a joke, Adrian had the ball under control and their striker just kicked it out of his hands, but they did hit the post and miss an easy chance when Adrian flapped at a cross.

2nd half was much better, same sort of tactics, but worked with jarvis and downing playing wide. We looked much more likely to score, but they managed to get a goal with their only real shot of the half. We scored 2 in the last 10 mins, with 2 great crosses into the 6 yard box and then their goalie didn't really have a chance, as Jarvis and Downing headed them in. I was pretty impressed with Lee, I thought he made some great runs, good pace and good movement, creating some chances out of nothing. Potts was decent, got forward well and defensively solid. Kouyate and Whitehead didn't do much, and the two subs who came on (don't know who they were) were decent, but didn't have much time to form an opinion. My man of the match would be Jarvis.

Overall, its a friendly, so not really bothered about the draw, but I'm glad we didn't lose.

&gt;

&gt;___Bad Sugar___ is a British comedy pilot, written by [Sam Bain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bain) and [Jesse Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Armstrong), based on an idea by the show's stars [Olivia Colman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Colman), [Julia Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Davis) and [Sharon Horgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Horgan). 

&gt;The programme centres on a wealthy, dysfunctional British mining dynasty, and is a parody of [telenovela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenovela)-style melodramas and soap operas such as *[Dallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_(1978_TV_series\))*.

&gt;It was shown on [Channel 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4) on 26 August 2012.  A full series was commissioned for broadcast in 2013   but cancelled before production with problems co-ordinating the core talents' schedules cited as the reason.

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Just curious, why do you think it should be legal?

There's a range of reasons people want it legalised.

I enjoy it and compared to things like alcohol or cigarettes, it's rather safe (some people do have issues with it, like any drug).  It's safe, enjoyable and doesn't have a significant impact on health (even less so if you don't smoke it - vape / food).

There's a lot of money to be made in allowing people to have a smoke / vape / edible.  Lots of money that, like Colorado showed in the first month alone, could go towards schools, hospitals etc.

I'd rather not be interacting with some of the people I do when I purchase cannabis.  I'd like my money to be funnelled into legal things, rather than some of the dodgy people I've dealt with in the past.

All that money which could be going towards public projects, is going into the hands of dealers.  Some are nice, some or nasty cunts.  Some are just people getting a bit of income on the side, some are people that will shoot / stab other people selling in their area.

Keep them on small wages and tell them the money will come the better they get. It's not just strikers, look at Sinclair, Rodwell, Wilshere. We ourselves saw it with the group that won back to back FA youth cups. Where are Paul Anderson, Adam Hammill, Goodwin Antwi, Jack Hobbs, Robbie Threlfall, Stephen Darby now? Even the players who got thrashed by Arsenal was supposed to have a number of players who would become squad players. The likes of Ayala, Irwin, Amoo, Ince, Kacaniklic, Dalla Valle. 

All were told that they were special, the next big things, all given contracts of high 4 to low 5 figures a week probably told that was the start of things. They should be given contracts of around £300 told they've done nothing yet and untill they're a 1st team regular they won't earn more than £500 a week. 

Remember last year and Andre Wisdom got lost and his car was stuck in the mud? That car was a £100,000 supercar! He's 19! Can you imagine the insurance on that? The cost of running it? At that point he had 22 first team games and was loaned out as he wasn't in the 1st team picture. Players of his age and experience should be able to afford to buy and run cars like that. They are still developing as players at that stage. Wisdom, while already a good player still has a long way to go to be the top defender we expect him to be.

Now compare that to a young Luis Suarez who's girlfriend has left Uruguay to move home to Spain. He can't afford to go see her, she can't afford to come see him. He knows he has to be the best player at Nacional to get a transfer to Europe. He goes to Gronigen gets a bit of a raise, works harder to get a transfer to Ajax and more money to support his fledgling family. There is motivation there.

The young players should be pulling up to training in beat up Novas seeing the established players in the supercars and being told, you want one of them then start training and become a 1st team regular .

&gt;every 15/20 min you have tv ads, how can you support this much cut in a movie ?

You were on the wrong channel. Vive la BBC ! (It's fantastic.)

&gt; i saw a little paper about people doing the wudu in the toilet 

I have no idea what this means but I'm not sure I like the sound of it.

&gt;Is there non-free cash withdrawal in England ?

Yes, there are some commerical ATMs like Link which charge you an extortionate amount of money to take out cash.

&gt;And the braille language on the toilet door was a nice touch too.

Very funny. I like that.

&gt;Do you have to buy the an entire bowl or can you buy one apple alone ?

Normally you can buy a single apple.

&gt;I don't really know what it is called in england but like that most of the ""walker passage"" were with a button to ask for the green sign.

Pelican crossing. Or pedestrian crossing.

true,aBeardOfBees,essex,Colchester,"Totally get where you're coming from here. I have a 2:1 in Philosophy and my wife has a 2:1 in law. She works as a solicitor and doesn't love it, but it's a solid profession to be in if you can stand it.

Bear in mind there are many facets to the law. My wife works in probate which is more people driven than the commercial stuff and attracts less repulsive colleagues. You could also work in house in other types of business, for example as a PI claims underwriter for an insurance company. Look into this sort of thing. 

My wife took a professional studies loan out for the LPC. It will cost you a lot in the end but if you want to do it then the upfront cost isn't an absolute barrier. 

For me I am here to go down the other route and tell you that your degree does not need to define your career. My first job was in insurance sales and paid £13k a year. Then I got a job underwriting home insurance for a big london insurer who had a branch where I lived. If things look bleak in the north look for companies like this with branches nearby. 

Then I moved into IT change management within that insurance firm, and for the last two years now work as an analyst for a software developer and earn a good living from this. The 2:1 in philosophy was simply a foot in the door for my career and your own degree can be the same if you want it to be. 

Don't be scared, just keep looking and applying for things. Employment Agents can help you but learn to question and not trust them too much. Get on their books and don't go for anything that doesn't sound right for you which they may suggest. 

You may need to start small and try to do quick career hops to progress. Don't feel you need to know where you're going right now. You'll get somewhere eventually.

&gt; Good afternoon
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for your recent contact about the government’s emergency legislation on communication data and interception, which is to be debated in the House of Commons on Tuesday.
&gt; 
&gt; As a result of a recent judgement by the European Court of Justice, the police and intelligence agencies are in danger of losing vital information which is used in 95% of serious and organised crime investigations as well as counter terror investigations and online child abuse. In order to prevent this, UK legislation therefore urgently needs to change to be compliant with EU law. If these changes are not made, the police are likely to suddenly lose vital evidence this summer.
&gt; 
&gt; The Government has come forward with emergency legislation and in considering the Government’s proposals, I believe it strikes the balance between maintaining the security of our citizens whilst ensuring that people’s privacy is protected. Serious criminal investigations and counter terrorism intelligence operations must not be jeopardised and that is why I, and my Labour colleagues are supporting the legislation to protect existing capabilities.
&gt; 
&gt; I do share the concerns raised about the rushed nature of these proposals being presented to Parliament, and I am pleased therefore that Labour has been able to secure safeguards within the limited timetable. Labour has ensured that the Government’s legislation is temporary and it will expire in 2016. This will require the Government and Parliament to properly consult on and consider longer term proposals next year.
&gt; 
&gt; Labour has also now secured agreement for a major independent review of the legal framework governing data access and interception (the RIPA review we called for earlier this year) in the light of the huge changes in technology. There is a clear need for wider public debate about the right balance between security and privacy online, a review of powers and stronger oversight and this review will enable longer term questions and concerns to be properly dealt with and debated in time for new legislation. Changes will then follow. Labour has also called for and secured further safeguards to restrict the ways in which communications data and intercept can be used to prevent misuse.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you again for your letter on this very important issue and I will continue to carefully consider the points you raise when this is debated in Parliament next week.
&gt; 
&gt; Yours sincerely
&gt;

true,Melberger,null,null,"*An in-depth review from a Porto fan*:


""Being a fan of a rival team, it would be like asking you to comment on a Manchester United player, more often than not, even if you thought you were being 100% neutral, your opinions are fueled by the rivaly. I always had that issue with Benfica players, because Ramires and David Luiz for instance are two obvious names that I never really rated and thought they sold them very well. I guess in Luiz's case I was proven right(despite what PSG paid for him). Ramires is still terrible on the ball, but it seems that his running still is appreciated. Javi Garcia is a much different case. We're talking about a guy that was discarded from Real Madrid(no shame in that, but already leaving the top level). For Benfica he was always at best steady, but never spectacular. He was slow even for the Portuguese League and he didn't really cover that much ground or made much of a difference. He was sold. Matic was giving the chance and he immediately gave Benfica a whole new gear. Even currently, Benfica went out and bought some Serbian guy on the cheap and he does what Garcia did for them. Clearly overpaid and he doesn't have anything special, apart from I guess having a good understanding of the game, being brought up in Spain with Real Madrid and through the youth ranks. 

In Portugal, Porto and Benfica have been selling players for huge sums for the last few years. ""Sponsored"" by funds and mainly Jorge Mendes(Ronaldo and Mourinho's agent who seems to dominate the market). Things are very inflated. Clubs sell players for 30M, but only really cash in 15 most times. It's a bit ridiculous and something that I am against(I would be in favour of clubs having to have 100% of the players economic rights), at the same time, that is probably what has driven the Portuguese League(or rather these two clubs in particular) to put the League right up there near the Italian League in the UEFA rankings and above the French League. The Dutch League has been completely blown away and they probably should be on par with Portugal. 

I say this because the business with Portuguese clubs, despite them being on the stock market and having to report these sales to the stock exchance, is very shady to put it this way. For instance, Fernando's contract was running out. He was thought to be leaving on a free, City having agreed personal therms with him. Mangala only became a client of Mendes recently(in the last year when his market value was already sky high). It was thought(back in January) that Porto were using Mangala to get some money for Fernando as well. Mangala's economic rights are owned by Porto and some funds. So the price was tied to the two players. It was given as a done deal with City. Last summer, some well positioned people at the club mentioned that they had rejected a 45M(Euros) offer for him from Chelsea. The process of the sale of Mangala has become very confusing, because basically he should have already signed for City, considering the info that leaked out in January. Back at Porto, some people aren't even sure that Fernando really signed a new contract! So, I do believe that Mangala has 'already' signed for City, I just don't understand what is delaying it. Chelsea bidding for him would make some sense, considering the lure of London and Mourinho being so close to Mendes, 

Sporting wise, Porto seems to have moved on from Mangala already. That Dutch defender at the World Cup, Martins Indi, seems to have been signed for a considerable amount(8.5M) and some other moves indicate that Mangala is as good as gone. 

Mangala came in from Standard Liege for a reasonable amount(6-7M). Porto eventually sold a part of his economic rights to a fund(as always...). He arrived in 2011/2012, the season after Villas Boas won everything at Porto and all the players were sought after in the market and most of them were wanting to leave and make a big contract abroad. So that season, 11/12, was really difficult. The club had to navigate through finding a new manager(picking AVB's assistant manager), selling players(like Falcao..), buying replacements and resisting offers for others, who stayed but were unsettled. Porto were seeds in the Champions League, but went out in the group stage. Went out early in the Cup. The new manager was never respected and there was always turbulence around the club. In the League, somehow managed to be in contention and in the end stole the league away from Benfica with their choking. So, it was not a good platform for new players to perform. Mangala didn't impress very much. He hardly played. Red flags were raised about him because he made too many errors and committed too many fouls and very hard ones.

In 12/13, Porto also didn't enjoy an easy season. In the previous season Falcao was lost and a decent replacement wasn't found. This time it was Hulk being sold(I know he flopped against City and isn't highly thought of in England generally, but he was great for Porto) and no replacement stepped up, so it was again a struggle the whole season, grinding out results. Very short squad. Some clear handicaps in the team. Again it was not an easy season for new players to flourish. The manager was still questioned(despite having won the league the previous year). Mangala was first used as a left back, he struggled mightly going forward at the start, this was the first season where he played regularly. While he was struggling at left back, the game time(which he lacked the previous season) were helping him settle in and be more composed and assured playing. He eventually moved to centre back and finished the season there with the emergency appearance at left back when necessary(Porto didn't have a backup left back!). While he impressed in many games due to his physicality, he still had too many mental errors, giving away cheap fouls and lacking positional awareness. Otamendi, who partnered him, had a better season.

13/14 was an horrible season for Porto. These last three seasons described, despite two league titles, have been hard to watch. This was one of the worst season of the last decades. The new manager was worse than Moyes. The team lost their identity, leaked comedy goals regularly and no one looked good. Despite this, Mangala became a leader of the team. He is(or was since he is gone) identified with the club, gave his all and is an humble guy. Played the day he found out his dad was passed away. Was made one of the captains of the team. 

Porto has had the likes of Ricardo Carvalho and Pepe in the last decade. Both sold for huge sums. Pepe is a good comparison, he also was very raw like Mangala and took a couple of seasons to polish at Porto, but when he left for Real Madrid(2007 30M) he was more polished than Mangala. You're basically buying (huge) potential, but still a very raw player with a lot of unknown about him. I personally think that many of his errors in Portugal were due to him not being challenged enough and relying on his physical attributes to make up for his mental errors. I always imagined that in a tougher league, with a manager on his toes and higher demands of him, that he'd be more focused and alert. Also, as I explained before, Porto didn't have the best of periods recently to nurture players like in the previous years.

He has grown a lot from 2011 to now, with his experience at left back, he also improved technically and he became very decent charging forward from the centre back position. While he hasn't played at the World Cup for France, he started a couple of games(friendly against the Dutch and the key game with Ukraine in the playoff), and he hardly put a foot wrong, I imagined he would be in contention to start given his performances and good critics(and thought Porto would be able to demand his ridiculous release fee of 50M), it seems that he is fourth choice for France. He is definitely better than the Liverpool guy. Koscielny is more of a wild card with the way he anticipates plays and commits to challenges. Mangala would be a mix of both. Great presence, but still very fast and agile. He proved in thos games(playing in the Stade de France) that he has it in him to be more cerebral and steady. He just needs to find that consistency to do it all the time and not have brain dead errors. Maybe take down his aggressiveness a notch and read the game a bit better, given his immense athletic ability, he will always be able to make up for the half second he takes to process better decisions. 

So, yeah, 40M... overpriced, but I suppose with these inflated fees(David Luiz for 50M distorts everything) and clubs going after the same players, you just have to overpay now. Clearly. He wasn't a consistent performer Porto. As in, at his best... it would be impossible to replace his impact and things that he did that not many athletes are able to do, but at the same time, overall, you'd be able to find someone less spectacular, but more consistent and steady. Giving you an example, Garay from Benfica and Argentina, was sold for 6M, he is way less spectacular, but he had a much better season. He moved to Russia. Mangala is moving to the Premier League Champions. Why? Potential. I feel like you're buying for a price as if he was the finished article of a top centre back, the thing is... he isn't finished! Back here, you'd love him one game. Hate him the next. Does he have the tools to be great? Definitely. Will he be? No one can say, but he has shown enough to believe he can reach that level. You're paying one year in advance for the level that he probably would have next year.""",0,1405188003,null,0,false,0,civjzxn,t3_2ai8tj,t1_civjzxn,t1_civdy21,null,1434682054,11,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,11

A law degree doesn't have to be used to work in that profession, it demonstrates to employers in other industries that you're a smart enough person to graduate with what is regarded as a pretty solid degree, not that your skills are exclusively confined to a very specific subject area.

I'm a biology graduate who's trained and worked as a mechanic, fabricator, a pharmacy technician and now an ambulance technician on my way to being a paramedic.  In between those I've worked in supermarkets and call centres. My degree has only ever really served to get my foot in the door of places by demonstrating a certain level of ability to learn.  I seem to have settled into my childhood plan of working in healthcare after many years of taking a very different direction.

Do what you want to do and use the skills and qualifications you have to achieve this.  You're obviously not going to get into a very specific niche profession but for all the talk of people being turned down for being over qualified I've not really encountered it. 

On the offchance it interests you, there's a pretty much country-wide shortage of paramedics and general ambulance clinicians - if the emergency services interests you then take a look.

*David Allen Green | Jul 11 11:23 |*

The UK government is pushing through emergency legislation.

[The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/328939/draft-drip-bill.pdf) was published yesterday, and the intention is that it will be an Act of Parliament by the end of next week. A legislative process which usually takes up a year will be truncated into seven days. This is law-making in a hurry.

Is there any good reason for this haste? The government says so. It points to [a decision of the European Court of Justice in April](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=150642&amp;doclang=EN) declaring the European Community’s [Data Retention Directive of 2006](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:105:0054:0063:EN:PDF) to be invalid. This in turn meant that the UK’s [implementing regulations of 2009](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/859/pdfs/uksi_20090859_en.pdf) would probably not survive legal challenge: for although the 2009 regulations remain nominally the law of the land, they were given legal force under [the European Community Act 1972](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/68/contents). This means that once a Directive falls, any implementing regulations are likely to be quashed by the UK courts.

This would be a problem for the UK government, for the 2009 Regulations provide the legal basis for insisting that a range of “public communications providers” – from mobile networks to internet service providers – have to retain communications data when that data otherwise would have to be deleted under data protection law. The 2009 Regulations ensure that such data is preserved for twelve months should the UK government require it.

So far, so plausible: there is a reason for the data retention regime of the 2009 Regulations to be placed on a firmer statutory footing following the ECJ decision.

But this is not what the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill (which has the unfortunate acronym DRIP) is doing; the DRIP Bill is going further than dealing with the ECJ decision. In effect, the UK government is using the ECJ decision as a pretext to force through, at speed, primary legislation affecting individual rights without proper scrutiny or deliberation. And the UK government has even managed to get the main opposition party to nod along with this. It is a remarkable and cynical political exercise.

So what is the UK government trying to get away with?

Here, one point to make is that there is, of course, no reason why this needs an emergency legislative process. The UK government has had since April to do something in response to the ECJ decision – and that decision was widely expected. Indeed, [many sensible observers back in 2006](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2006/wp119_en.pdf) warned that the Data Retention Directive was flawed. So this is not some sudden crash scenario; it has been a journey of almost ten years. The UK government has had a long time to prepare for the Data Retention Directive being struck down as a matter of European law.

A second point is that the DRIP Bill does nothing directly to address the concerns of the ECJ in its April decision; its main purpose is to make the UK’s data retention regime less open to legal attack.

At paragraph 65 of its decision, the ECJ stated:

&gt;    65 It follows from the above that Directive 2006/24 does not lay down clear and precise rules governing the extent of the interference with the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter [of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]. It must therefore be held that Directive 2006/24 entails a wide-ranging and particularly serious interference with those fundamental rights in the legal order of the EU, without such an interference being precisely circumscribed by provisions to ensure that it is actually limited to what is strictly necessary.

&gt;    66 Moreover, as far as concerns the rules relating to the security and protection of data retained by providers of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks, it must be held that Directive 2006/24 does not provide for sufficient safeguards, as required by Article 8 of the Charter, to ensure effective protection of the data retained against the risk of abuse and against any unlawful access and use of that data. In the first place, Article 7 of Directive 2006/24 does not lay down rules which are specific and adapted to (i) the vast quantity of data whose retention is required by that directive, (ii) the sensitive nature of that data and (iii) the risk of unlawful access to that data, rules which would serve, in particular, to govern the protection and security of the data in question in a clear and strict manner in order to ensure their full integrity and confidentiality. Furthermore, a specific obligation on Member States to establish such rules has also not been laid down.

In contrast, and perhaps tellingly, neither the DRIP Bill [nor the explanatory notes](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/328940/draft-drip-notes.pdf) even mention the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the actual basis of the ECJ’s decision to strike the Data Retention Directive down. Perhaps the UK government is pretending the Charter does not exist.

Does this mean that when enacted the DRIP Bill will be safe from challenge on the basis of EU law? Who knows. But it would seem that the intention of the UK government is to shift the basis of data retention law from EU law, where it is vulnerable to challenge, to national law, where the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy makes any legal challenge to primary legislation near-impossible. It is thereby not so much a change of mere legal form but a transformation of legal substance. The effect of this new Act would be likely to remove the rights from UK parties which were relied on by the parties before the ECJ.

Then there is the actual content of the DRIP Bill. Here is the most remarkable point of all: for over half the Bill is not directly to do with the ECJ judgment or the 2009 Regulations. Clauses 3, 4, and 5 of the six clause Bill instead amend the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) – the legal regime, among other things, for intercepting communications.

And these are significant amendments, even though the UK government is seeking to make out that they are mere “clarifications”.

One amendment, which is liberal, is to limit the ability of the UK government to intercept a communication on the basis of “the economic well-being” of the UK to situations where this also involves national security. That is fine and welcome, but it does not need emergency legislation.

The next amendment is certainly not liberal: the UK government wants to extend the scope of Part I of RIPA – the entire interception regime – on to an “extra-territorial” basis, thereby placing duties on non-UK entities providing communications services in the UK to comply with interception warrants.

The UK government is maintaining that such extra-territoriality was always “implicit” in the 2000 Act; but as the UK government admits in the explanatory notes, telecommunications is now more “globalised” than in 2000.

But this is not a cosmetic change. Part I of RIPA places onerous obligations on those served with interception warrants. A failure to comply with a warrant carries serious legal consequences. Unless there is express reference to non-UK persons, it is unlikely a court would apply the obligations in Part I to non-UK persons.

The UK government knows this. So whilst they seek to spin the extension of Part I of RIPA as a “clarification”, the amendments to RIPA under clause 4 of the DRIP Bill are certainly not just for the avoidance of doubt. The amendments are instead heavy-duty legislative drafting, bolting on the Act everything needed to extend the scope of the many onerous duties to non-UK persons. It even appears to extend the criminal offence under section 11(7) of RIPA to non-UK persons. There is no sensible way this is “clarificatory”.

And it gets worse: clause 5 of the DRIP Bill extends the definition of “telecommunications service” in RIPA.

In RIPA, the relevant definition is:

&gt;    “telecommunications service” means any service that consists in the provision of access to, and of facilities for making use of, any telecommunication system (whether or not one provided by the person providing the service).

The DRIP Bill will add:

&gt;    For the purposes of the definition of telecommunications service in
    subsection (1), the cases in which a service is to be taken to consist in the
    provision of access to, and of facilities for making use of, a
    telecommunication system include any case where a service consists in
    or includes facilitating the creation, management or storage of
    communications transmitted, or that may be transmitted, by means of
    such a system.

The UK government maintains this addition means only that the definition of “telecommunications service” will “now include companies who provide internet-based services, such as webmail”.

That construction is not obvious from the proposed addition; indeed, on the bare wording of the new provision, a whole range of “facilitating” communications could be included. But even taking the UK government’s statement at face value, the extension is beyond that intended in the 2000 Act. Again this is not a “clarification” and should not be done by emergency legislation. And this definition matters, as it provides for what can be subjected to an interception warrant.

My legal analysis above is a preliminary one; other commentators may have better and alternative views. But if my interpretation is correct, then the DRIP Bill is intended to take away the rights of individuals under EU law, to place onerous new obligations on non-UK persons to comply with interception warrants (and in doing so make new interferences with the rights of the individuals in respect of that data), and to expand the definition of telecommunications services in respect of which those warrants apply.

Each one of these points should be subject to proper consultation and parliamentary scrutiny, and not rushed through using an emergency legislative procedure.

The removals of civil liberties, and the encroachments of the state, are rarely sudden and dramatic. It is often a subtle change of legal form here, and the deft widening of legal definitions there. And before one knows it, the overall legal regime has changed to the advantage of officials and the otherwise powerful, and all we have done is nod-along as it happens.

Between the yearly season review released by the club, analysis offered by plenty of dedicated Spurs blogs, Match of the Day analysis and frequent articles across message boards and newspapers, I don't see what you're doing really sticking out from the crowd. Also, if might be a total nightmare being about to use footage from Spurs games, I can't see them letting you do that over the course of a huge project. A small highlight on a website is grand to slip under the radar, this idea not so much.

While it might not be as exciting as a video project, I think starting up your own blog would be a far better way to explore these topics and would not cost anywhere near the same amount of money. Also, I don't see the worth in reviewing a lot of transfer rumours or media speculation after the fact. It's all well and good speculating at the time, but would I really want to see a video now about how we were linked to Leandro Damaio or Willian last season? Not really, it adds nothing.

I hate to be such a critic, because maybe a video project is a passion of your's but I know how hard they are to get right. The form you've chosen isn't the easiest to execute by any means, does not suit your topic and is real expensive considering you can get a lot of the information you've talked about elsewhere for free and that's only by some miracle you get Spurs' blessing to continue the project...

You don't need 'savings' but the fact that you have them is even better.  I haven't been in your position in the sense that I enjoy the career I've taken up but, regardless, travel is the Holy Grail.

Go online, spend £50 of your savings and get a cheap (Groupon), for-the-sake-of-it, minimum-level TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certificate.  You can do some of them in a weekend.

Go abroad for a year (or two or three or four).  It's way easier than it seems at first thought - teach English in Hong Kong/China/Singapore/Thailand/Vietnam - do it! Cost of living in the Far East is dirt cheap and, depending on your employer, nine times out of ten, your accommodation will be included too.

It might seem cliché but travelling - or rather 'living abroad' - changes you completely.

true,popsimax,Emmanuel,Emmanuel,"Re: grading system. In theory, there is a certain threshold you have to reach to get a first (70%), 2.i (60%), 2ii (50%) and a third (40%). For Nat Sci, there is no set number of people fall into each category. 

But in practice, **in the final year** the marking of papers is modulated (or  ""manipulated"") so that almost no-one can get a third, and few get a 2ii. The number of firsts is hard to predict though, and can vary for the same course quite widely between years from a minimum of 3 or 4 out of a class of 90, to much more. It's all quite mysterious, not helped by examiners meetings where they will review exam scripts and decide whether they can give you a low mark on paper 1 without dropping you into a lower category, or a higher mark on paper 2 without elevating you into a grade they feel you don't really merit. Yes, this actually happens. So it's quite difficult to say whether any individual course is going to get you higher or lower grades for a certain level of effort; moreover, every class you are involved in is going to give you an absurd amount of work. There are no easy courses here. 

If you are bit over-confident in your first two years you might find you get a bunch of low grades you don't feel you deserve. You'll never find out why, because you are not allowed to see your exam script in case you try to appeal the mark, and thus can't learn from the 3 month long trauma of taking end of year exams. This is something you just have to live with, and work harder next time. Yay.

This all sounds super miserable. But it'll all work out in the end. Good luck!",0,1405190618,null,0,1405190885,0,civl3kv,t3_2ai1jb,t1_civl3kv,t3_2ai1jb,null,1434682671,2,false,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,2

House prices in the UK are not high for the same reason they were in America or Spain or Ireland before the crash- in those countries there was lots of supply, but minimal demand.  Millions of homes lay empty, so builders resorted to encouraging people with less and less money to borrow more and more cash to pay for them.

In the UK, the supply of housing is far more constrained.  Even wealthier people find it hard to buy houses, especially in expensive cities.  Demand is high if supply is low, which is the 'natural order' of economics, rather than a tulip-bulb level crisis.

People *have* money, if they lived in other countries they could easily afford properties with their salaries and/or savings, there are just very few houses to spend that money on in the UK, which drives prices up.  This is slightly different to the American situation, in which people who genuinely would *never* have been able to buy homes were goaded into buying them at ridiculous rates. 

The central risk, of course, is that some kind of global disaster could cause a mass default in the UK and crash the entire economy because the banks would go bust as no one could afford to pay their mortgage.  It would be wise to build more houses and gently lower demand before that happens.

Scene One: Young-ish man (who has been popping up in most of BT's ads in the last few years) and his dad.

Two: Dad from one and random cabbie.

Three: Same cabbie at the Dentist's, Dentists and Creepy Assistant present.

Four: Dentist and his date (shaking my head at this - got to get the token ethnic minority in the advert, but keep her a ""safe"" hue).

Five - The Dentists date is now at a car boot, presumably not her tat being sold because she is young and it all seems to be the sort of detritus you find in an old person's house. Chatting away to an older geezer, as you have to convince all dmeographics how amazing your broadband is.

Six - ""Super duper"" stereotypical older guy seems happy.

I give Bony the edge over Lambert because Bony is 7 years younger.

Bony may not be the sexiest name out there but he has the skill and talent to work under Rodgers and could be valuable to us as we battle on multiple fronts this season.

I've become much more politically active as a result, and even if the situation still stays grim for myself, I feel like I'm undertaking much more rewarding activity than just struggling on my own to exist. Also if you are particularly career minded (bah!), you can put your experience towards working for an NGO where you will be doing some concrete good. There's also some strong cooperative movements you can be part of which aren't exploitative, despite being full of hideous middle class liberals. I'd personally like to see the whole system change but we all deserve to be able to make a life for ourselves in the meantime.

Also, never ever feel bad for feeling bad. Fuck that right off.

true,davegod,uk,United Kingdom,"Law is a good degree to have. 

It is generally highly respected; if you have two job applicants who are otherwise equal (both with degrees not directly related to the job) then law is a high value card, it likely to trump whatever the other guy has. It might even trump a directly-related degree. 

It is also something that might give you a specialism in another field that is not necessarily obviously related. For example, accountancy is a good profession to go into without an accounting degree - one, at most two years studying towards the professional qualification you will have caught up with people who left uni at the same time as you with an accountancy degree (I'm not pretending it won't be hard work, but it is very common and the structure is there for you). Degrees in law, IT, economics and mathematics can be *more* attractive to accountancy firms as you are more likely to be able to go into speciality fields which are very profitable.  

I'm not specifically advocating accountancy, just giving an example to demonstrate one of many options available and how your 3 years studying law were a sound investment *if you exercise it*. That said, incidentally accountancy is also pretty decent professional qualification to get and then move into something which is not directly accounting, it's like being able to speak a new language - you don't have to become a translator for it to be useful. Similarly, legalese is a language.

Other things that jump immediately to mind that you might consider are HR, a plethora of local or national government jobs... 

I am thinking the real problem you face is you have no idea what doors are out there, how to find them and getting the gumption to go opening them. It's tough when you get out of uni and into the ""real world"", I've been there. You're used to all these well-signposted paths and now they're gone, you have to learn a sense of direction and venture out into the unknown. 

Talk to friends, family of friends, your uni will have a careers service very likely open to alumni, the job centre is probably balls but they might have links with some kind of non-profit careers advisor (the job centre will probably require that you go on some course put on by these at some point). A *good* recruitment agent. Read local council vacancies (typically they have a special website or whatever and don't advertise elsewhere unless desperate).

Well I can tell you it was a waste of time. Infact, i've spent most of my adult life working in the hospitality trade and I love it.

I'm now working as a regional trainer for a large company delivering vocational qualifications and helping those who didn't do well in formal education get ahead. I've always gone for the jobs I thought interesting and never given too much consideration to my 'lifeplan' because I didn't have one. Now i'm 32, have a house and 2 kids, guess what? Still no idea where life will take me next. Hospitality is always there, recession or not, so why not look into that? You can train people, work in HR, recruitment, become an area manager.

I live in the North too and I can totally see where you are coming from, the UK as a whole has taken a massive hit the last few years but people still have jobs, industry still moves on. 

As a side note, the job centre can be arseholes but if you work with them and give the poor bastards a bit of respect (which they don't get from the unwashed masses who just want their giro to go and drink themselves into a stupor) they can be of great help. Get you onto courses that would otherwise have cost thousands (I gained an entry level teaching qualification through them). If you can show that you have some sort of path mapped out then you shouldn't be pushed into any old position just to get you off the dole (I admit that a little bit of blagging is needed here).

Think of what you enjoy, work out where your strengths can be used within that role and get at it. Life is hard sometimes but its what you make of it. You sound like an intelligent guy but with a bit of an inferiority complex and a massive downer on yourself and life in general.

It will get better, I promise you. Set your sights high and give it everything.

I rate Bony too, but he seems to be off to the kopites. For me, I don't want Ba as a first choice striker, he's not used to playing that many games and paying for an aging striker just doesn't seem like a good choice for us. On loan I, maybe instead of Traore if we can't get him, I think he could be a good choice. As for Welbeck, I really can't make my mind up about him. I wouldn't mind him but other people seem to think that he's shit and I can't say I've watched him play loads of matches.

I reckon if we get Besic we won't get Rodwell or Sanchez. I think it's a little bit sad what's happened to Rodwell now, I wish we could just pick him up on a free but I don't want to spend money on an injury prone player. Hopefully getting Besic will also mean no Cleverly, although he could possibly be good under Martinez, not a very exciting transfer though. Bojan seems to be off to Hull? Not too bothered about that though, if we wanted him we'd get him and he hasn't impressed much on his other loans. I'm hoping for Adama Traore or some other young Barca B player instead.

true,maxefc,newcr-1,,"I feel that many people feel that we only need a couple of players to keep this team competitive in both the premier league top 6 and now the added pressures of the europa league.

 Keeper and fullbacks are fine and we have capable back ups especially for the fullback (oviedo/stones/hibbert?). 

Jags and distin are good but are starting to look shaky, and with distin on his very last legs, a centre back has to be a priority. Stones is a work in progress and alcaraz is nowhere near the standard we should be looking at. the youngsters are again not up to the quality we need right now. 

Defensive midfield is now sorted especially with the impending besic signing.

 Left and right midfield is a huge problem as pienaar looked very poor in the games he played last season. he has lost the acceleration he once used so well to link with baines and so only seems to slow down play. mcgeady is again an ok winger who showed glimpses of quality in the his brief spells in the team. mirallas is quality and a player who got better as the season went on. this means we have 3 wingers with at least one being not up to the standard we should want at the club to play over 60 games in the coming season. we need at least 2 signings with my choice being perisic and a loan deal using bobby's 'links'. 

attacking midfield is a position where i would like to see a signing but its not one of desperate need. barkley is special but needs to be handled and controlled like martinez did last season. when he isnt playing osman may be ok but i would love to see someone such as firmino from hoffenhiem. or someone who can also play outwide such as tadic who southampton have stolen. 

Strikers are our so so important. naisy showed he can have a go and perform just well enough to get us though a few games but only just. the other two are just awful. lukaku now is a complete must! lost out most the top strikers now so there is very little left. as we play 1 upfront maybe carry on the chelsea raid and take ba as well as the back up/sub/europa.

One last point. Why cant we spend what clubs like west ham are spending?

We finished 8th with no Europe in Kenny's last season, so I don't think the lack of those few extra games was that big of a factor in our title push.

&gt; we were reliant on Aaron Ramsey and his energy in midfield and Walcott was a big miss as our midfield lacked pace without him.

Right there, you were *reliant* on the attributes of two players and couldn't adjust to playing without them. Suarez was suspended and we had injuries to Sturridge, Gerrard, Lucas, and Johnson. We also had only one legitimate winger in the team. In both cases, players played out of position and we lined up in various formations to accommodate for any shortcomings, managing to plug along without really looking any worse off.

Don't get me wrong, Arsenal is not shit. On their day, they can beat anyone, much like the rest of the top 7 teams in England can. Chelsea and City are definitely the most flush with talent, but even then, the difference between 1st-7th is a very fine margin. All of these teams have good managers and are stocked with talent. When that's the case, chemistry, motivation, and all of that intangible shit is what separates those teams.

IMO, Arsenal lack the resilience that Liverpool has to really push on and progress. Their record of consistency and success for basically the last 20 years is impressive and I definitely respect that, but my money is on the team that has shown massive forward momentum for the last season and half rather than one that has been treading water for ten years.",0,1405199222,null,0,false,0,civort9,t3_2aiosx,t1_civort9,t1_civnz3k,null,1434684391,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

true,Cyridius,irish,Ireland,"&gt;I suggest you go read up on the official commiserations your country gave when Hitler died

Oh noes, we said ""I'm sorry for your loss"", that surely outweighs everything Ireland and Irish people did for the Allies during the war.

I guess working with British intelligence to hunt down German spies, repatriating all British airmen(While keeping the Germans), sharing weather reports, allowing use of airspace(Neither of which we gave the Germans) and having a fallback base in Ireland for the Brits if they lost at home and the thousands of Irish troops that fought in both the American and British armies, are nothing in comparison to ""We're sorry for your loss"". 

If Denmark and Norway - Which maintained explicit neutrality, just like Ireland. The only difference is that the Brits sold them weapons, which you refused to for us - can be counted as nations that were friendly to Allies or part of the Allies, Ireland can certain be up there given that we contributed more to the Allied war effort than either of those - Fuck, the Danish help wasn't even from their government, it was just random Danish volunteers, and yet they're considered a member of the Allies despite having no prior involvement with them. And that's forgetting that a large number from both of those countries also volunteered for the German forces.

Ireland maintained explicit neutrality towards Germany; Not giving any information, not repatriating and soldiers, and not accepting any weapons that they offered - for free, I might add - Despite the fact the British wouldn't help us. The signing of the book of condolences was a part of that. 

However, we bent every rule of neutrality for the Brits. We were absolutely a pro-Allies country, but it was common sense to have a contingency plan for when you lost, given that you and the US categorically refused to sell us arms, we had absolutely nothing to defend ourselves with if we broke neutrality. Thanks for that one, Churchill.

And after the war, despite all the shit Ireland did, we were called cowards and traitors to the free world by the mighty Winston Churchill. 

So, I tell you what, I know my country's history. Don't presume to educate me on it. I suggest that before you try shit talking Irish history, you read something more thorough. ",1,1405200331,null,0,false,0,civp91i,t3_2ai0pq,t1_civp91i,t1_civole5,null,1434684664,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

More ""likes"" gets Britain First more subscribers, so that allows them to spread their message further - they intersperse harmless popular content with bullshit about ""this street in Little Pudsley is a sharia law no-go-zone"" and ignorant people believe it because they're dumb or because it affirms their prejudices.

&gt; No.

From the [actual study](http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/news_/CCTV_modest_impact_on_crime.php) that Guardian piece is based on:

&gt; Results of this review indicate that CCTV has a **modest but significant desirable effect on crime**, is most effective in reducing crime in car parks, is most effective when targeted at vehicle crimes (largely a function of the successful car park schemes), and is more effective in reducing crime in the United Kingdom than in other countries. **These results lend support for the continued use of CCTV to prevent crime in public space, but suggest that it be more narrowly targeted** than its present use would indicate. Future CCTV schemes should employ high-quality evaluation designs with long follow-up periods. 

Compare the first line of the Guardian piece:

&gt; The use of closed-circuit television in city and town centres and public housing estates **does not have a significant effect on crime**, according to Home Office-funded research to be distributed to all police forces in England and Wales this summer.

Basic errors.

true,rainator,cnty-wales,Cardiff,"&gt;-Before going to a conference i watched a tv show while working on my pc which was about tv concil. Is this common in England to have show about this kind of thing ? In France i never saw this kind of thing.
&gt;-CCTV...everywhere, even in little town, in little streets...is it really effective ?

Its not very effective, or even popular, but i don't think people really care

&gt;-I tried to watch a movie on tv (jurassic park 3) but i stopped because it was like every 15/20 min you have tv ads, how can you support this much cut in a movie ?

try going to the states, it feels like every thirty seconds, my brother has a habit of constantly changing the channel when they come on.

&gt;-The city (chatham) had a lot of bin, i saw a lot of place in order to recycle things (even in the university), great. I hope it would be like that in my country, we really don't recycle enough. And a 80 pounds fine because you throw something on the ground could do some good here too.

we  started running out of room to dump shit

&gt;-Secular university. While going to the bathroom in the university, i saw a little paper about people doing the wudu in the toilet and asking for them to clean after (and even saw a prayer room for muslim). It was nice to see that the university accepted it if they respected the other people too, good point for the university because here where i live you would never see this.(and i am atheist i precise).
And the braille language on the toilet door was a nice touch too.

universities have a lot of student participation in their governence, so if a lot of students want something it can be organised

&gt;-In the city i wanted to get some money and at the atm i read "" free cash withdrawal"". Is there non-free cash withdrawal in England ?

usually in pubs and places where cash machines arent very common

&gt;-While having a walk i town center i noticed your shop are selling  fruit and vegetable outside in  plastic bowls. Like 4/5 apples in a bowl. Isn't this a waste of time/place ? Do you have to buy the an entire bowl or can you buy one apple alone ?

you can buy them individually, but people like to get a weeks shopping at once

&gt;-pawnshop everywhere. Is this normal in England ? I saw more pawnshop in a 2h walk in chatham than in my entire life in France.

there are a lot of charity shops because the council gives them tax breaks

&gt;-I knew there were a lot of magpie in England but i was not prepared for this !

lots of seagulls as well

&gt;-I don't really know what it is called in england but like that most of the ""walker passage"" were with a button to ask for the green sign. This way the traffic must be more fluid i would think instead of having mandatory stop every 2 minutes.

- With regards to CCTV I think it is worth mentioning that most of the cameras are private, not ran by the government. I don't think it is effective, but yeah, we have a lot of CCTV cameras.

- The BBC doesn't have adverts but all other channels do. I tend to find that most shows in a half hour time frame have a five minute advert (a minute of which normally advertises upcoming shows for the channel) in the middle of the show and around five minutes between shows. However, I when movies are shown I usually find adverts to be shown half as much. I've just finished watching a movie that Wikipedia says had a 95 minute running time and it took up a little over 110 minutes (though I had it recorded so I skipped adverts).

- I often find myself noticing a lack of bins where I go.

- Acceptance of different religions at different universities seems to be the norm. One of the Uni's I went to had rooms for prayer. The Uni I go to now has a multi-faith Chaplaincy, and I've often seen many religious-themed events. There was a Sikh-week for example where they set up a marquee and served food of their culture (first you would wash your hands and cover your head), and other religious groups have had similar events (the Christian one was a little preachy for me).

- There is non-free cash withdrawal in England but I personally find most places do free cash withdrawal. The none-free ones tend to be machines set up in newsagents (and strip clubs).

- You can buy one apple alone.

- It might be comforting to see as many police cars as you saw but it isn't a norm that I experience. I was driving around for hours today and I saw one, which was outside a fire station.

- There are a lot of pawnshops, and more seem to have opened since the recession.

- I often see condom machines in toilets. Never see them used though, but mens toilets aren't a place I tend to hang around.

true,MGharibian,newcr-6,"suffering at the hands of Martinez' evil twin, Fartinez","Wait I'm a little confused at some of these comments here. 

1- distin on his last legs? I know he's old but he hasn't shown any signs of wear, in fact he was more consistent than jags last season. There are defenders playing for better teams than everton who are nearing 40, it all depends on the individual player. And distin hasn't given any indication that the age is getting to him yet. So I don't know about ""on his last legs,"" he may very well have a few seasons more in him, and in a world where players aren't always loyal to clubs anymore, 2 seasons is a good deal.

2- stones is a work in progress? Last season he did so well that Roberto was being asked / seriously considering whether he should just keep starting him instead of jags. You say oviedo is so good, but I would argue that stones had a much much better breakout season than oviedo did, even before his injury. 

3- I agree on left mid but how is right mid a huge problem? We are deeper in right mid than any other position, by definition. That is, we have more capable players in that position. We have mirallas, Mcgeady as a backup even though he's good enough to start (find me one example of his play that indicated he shouldn't), and Naismith playing on the right when he's needed and Roberto wants to try mirallas centrally. Mirallas, Mcgeady, and naismith in one position = a huge problem? I can't see that, I'm sorry man.

4- judging by the logic you've used concerning right mid and cb (having a very high standard for deepness, saying we need a replacement for distin just because he's old even though he's playing well, and discounting alcaraz for his bad performances) how is the keeper position ok? How? Howard is great but he's 35 years old, and our one replacement is absolutely terrible every time he's ever played for us. People have denied in discussion that he will continue to be terrible, and that's up for discussion, but I've never seen someone deny that he has been terrible. So you're saying the keeper position is ok even though we have no depth at all, and we have a 35 year old keeper and one backup who is terrible and we just let go 2 of our older youth keepers, but you don't think distin is ok because he's old and you don't think alcaraz is ok because he's terrible like Joel and you don't think we have depth on the right with 3 capable RMs. I really don't understand that.

5- same kind of thing, you said we're ""not in desperate need"" of an attacking mid, because we have barkley and osman. Barkley and osman. The former is really young and only just had his breakthrough season, just like stones who you said is ""a work in progress"" for that reason, and osman who is old af for his position, just like distin, who, you know. And so a position with the inexperienced barkley and the old osman is less desperate than a position with the ample-aged, proven skill mirallas, Mcgeady, and naismith? Huh?

6- why can't we spend what clubs like west ham are spending? Why don't we spend 80 million? It's been a week into the transfer window, how could you possibly judge what we should have spent by now. Also, we've signed Gareth Barry already who's a player that is significantly above west ham's level, and even if that was a cheaper deal money spent doesn't correlate to player worth necessarily. West Ham signs players who a lot of times aren't good enough for everton. 

7- ""lukaku is now a complete must!"" you just spent that whole long post talking about all these positions that we need to fill, even cb and rm, and lukaku is a complete must?

My first hedgehog died as she had mites and the vets gave her medicine which poisoned her :(

Took ages to dare buy another because I was so upset, and i made sure everything was new because I was paranoid about my bpy getting mites. Within a week of getting him, I did a check and he had mites. I was devastated the breeder said they definitely werent from her, but I don't know how he could've got them otherwise. The vet (a different one) wouldn't treat him as he was still so small, but even she had to put a scraping under a microscope to see them so the breeder couldve easily not noticed them. He sadly died last month, do not know why but I don't think it was mite related.

true,pylori,cnty-england,East Midlands,"&gt; The market is saturated with up to 20% of graduates not getting a job after qualifying.

I think this is a bit misleading, from my understanding anyway. The market is most definitely not oversaturated, as evidenced by the fact that almost a quarter of all doctors on the register are foreign trained (expected to rise to a third by 2020). We have a shortage of doctors, if anything. The problem is that we don't train enough medical students, nor do we really have the funds to, to supply the GPs that we need to provide adequate care.

In terms of the 20% of graduates not getting a job, what are your sources? I've heard the number has increased, but nowhere near that high. Moreover, analysis tends to show that those that do not attain a foundation spot after uni fail to do so generally because they apply to foundation schools outside their means (that is, apply for London deaneries when they are not going to score highly enough) or that they do not rank enough foundation schools or in an order that will work out best for them. This is shown by the fact that of those who do not attain a foundation post after graduation, the vast majority do when they reapply the next year (assuming they do not end up finding a standalone F1 spot in the meantime).

As for your situation, of course demand with each specialty is different and based on location too. An anaesthetist will likely find it easier to get a job than a neurophysiologist which is very specialised. Trying to get a job in London is going to be an impossible task, in contrast to Wales where there is frequently a shortage of doctors. Are you looking for substantive consultant posts now? I can understand how those are difficult to find in the ideal location and the like, for sure.

Also there are a number of factors why some people who would identify as Irish would prefer not to be governed by Ireland, chief among them is that territory is a mess, a drain on the UK's economy and is the UK's problem to deal with.

I totally understand if no one wants to go down the route of explaining cultural differences so feel free to ignore but I've always wondered about this. Americans generally tend to check eachother in public if we feel that someone is violating rules or generally behaving like a jackass (cutting in line, talking in the quiet section, refusing to give a seat up to the disabled, etc.). However, I've seen mention of the British reluctance to do this many times in this and other subs and I've always wondered what the seemingly universal  restraint is all about. 

It doesn't seem to be fear-based as much as a polite society gesture, i.e., avoiding a scene. Is that what it is or is there another cultural consideration at play?

And please don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the American way is better. Correcting the behavior of others (or, more aptly, reminding them of rules or expectations) is sometimes effective but can lead to shouting matches or worse in America if you're dealing with someone who just doesn't give a damn. So, yes, even Americans have to pick our battles in these situations but we're more inclined to address it than not.

Rarely. I think only Leicester really require one or two years worth of professional healthcare experience, and while some people do duck it out for a year or two as a HCA, it's certainly not the norm to need that much. Most of my friends, including myself, who applies and were successful had casual, but regular, experience such as weekly volunteering at the hospital or hospice.

&gt;anything below the top 5% is unlikely to be good enough

eh, this is a bit much. if you do above average, you can get by fine if your application is otherwise excellent. my score put me in the top 15% and was not as good as my friend's, which can partly explain why she got more offers than I did, but I was still accepted. Most of the people who I talked to had scores like mine and my friends, those in the top 5% were rarely encountered.

&gt;and have at least a high 2:1, preferably a 1st

This more true than the previous statements. A first or solid 2.1 will definitely bode really well for you. I was a solid 2.1 when I applied, and wasn't predicted a first on my reference either, but I definitely think it would have helped me more with other offers if I did better.

&gt;Extra qualifications eg. Masters and PhD are not counted.

This isn't necessarily true. A few unis will actually lower the minimum undergrad classifications to a 2.2 with a PhD. And while not inherently of as much value as your undergrad degree, having extra training and experience is certainly not going to count against you. Of course you shouldn't do a masters or PhD just to get onto medicine after, that would be rather silly, but that's not to say they don't value the skills you pick up during postgrad studies if you can adequately explain why you chose to do medicine.

true,algerining,lfc93,,"I'm very happy with Can, Lallana, and Lambert. Lallana and Lambert are players you know can make an instant impact because they've proven themselves in the league already. And they add bodies to the places we needed more of (striker and attacking mid.) Can is a talented young player who will get to rotate with Gerrard and eventually take over, which takes a lot of pressure off Can to settle in immediately. IMO, three excellent signings already made.

Markovic I like for the long run. I see him having a rough first season honestly. He's a little slight, and the overwhelming opinion is that he would have done very well with an extra season in Portugal. I have no doubt that he can be an immense player down the line, but I think he'll take some time to grow into the league.

I'd love to get Moreno, and with the Aspas link coming out, I'm thinking this deal might be getting a renewal. I don't know that he would be the immediate savior to our problems in defense, and I also don't know that he would definitely usurp Enrique immediately. But Moreno would be amazing to have for the future.

Origi would be a good grab for the future. Another year with Lille would be good. And he wouldn't have the pressure of replacing Suarez. Would be a solid buy, even if a slightly inflated price.

I know Bony is a little controversial around here, but I like him. He's big and he's strong, but he's also technically sound and has an eye for goal. He wouldn't replace Suarez, but he could add some much needed goals in rotation or off the bench.

On the subject of Lovren... well, I really don't know on this one. If Brendan wants Lovren, then it's probably a good move. I haven't watched Lovren enough to disagree. And despite what others are saying, I don't think we could get Hummels or similar for the same price.

Obviously, I'd also love to see Shaqiri come, but with Markovic looking eminent, that deal seems dead.

We can agree to disagree on that. However, you are now quoting me out of context (not a good start if you want to be a lawyer) when you refer to professional standards. I referred to lawyers standards in relation to doctors, not law-degree layers v GDL lawyers.

A language could be useful but what I'm trying to say is, it would have no realistic impact on a law firms decision between a law graduate and a GDL graduate. It would perhaps be relevant in picking between two law graduates or two GDL students, where the experience in law would be the same between candidates. As for the relevance of a language to commercial law and contract law, it is negligible. International Private law  is usually incorporated in a full law degree, as is commercial law and tort law (and contract). Languages are not necessary at all for these. 

For your last point, I can only imagine that these firms are encountering those people who are doing accelerated/post-grad law degrees. A person who does honours will do tort law at honours level if they want to go into that area of law. If they do not do tort law and do more public law or criminal, etc, at honours then the applicants are being very unwise to apply to firms wo deal with tort law. That is common sense.

.

I think the biggest problem for Lamela last year was a lack of confidence.

I'm going to go ahead and assume that he knew very little about Spurs before he came historically/current squad. So here's a guy who's going to be Roma's next star, going to be playing there maybe his whole career if everything works out, had some time to settle, probably had a decent grasp of Italian being Argentine, then suddenly, bang! ""This team in England just met your buyout clause, you should probably start learning English, thanks for everything."" Following this people in England were saying that Lamela would replace Bale. A player who allegedly cost £86m and is now playing for one of the biggest sports brands in all of the world's sports. No pressure... oh and there are only a couple of people at the club who speak Spanish. Oh and the media in England is saying that it's a club-record transfer, the amount of pressure he must have felt early on, especially with his family not having moved to his new home yet. I felt bad for the guy but hoped for the best. That, unfortunately, is not what I got.

Two managerial changes and a long-term injury later, I think he'll be just fine next year. I've watched a couple of the games he was involved in last season and while his best games clearly weren't at the level of competition he will face day in day out in the Premier League, they are fascinating to watch. There are three games last year in which I believe we saw glimpses of the real Lamela; In the Carling Cup vs Villa, home vs Sheriff and home vs Anzhi.  All three of those games, he visibly got more confident as the game went on, even scoring against Sheriff, but the most important thing I noticed is how much more of the ball he was getting by the end of these matches. This to me is him proving to his teammates that he deserves their trust, but also replacing his trust in himself. He's had a year to get to know the squad, and we now have arguably the most competent manager since well, I actually don't even know. Eriksen is going to be *fully* settled next year and will only get better, Soldado and he are obviously close friends so I can see them bagging a few assists for each-other's goals. Everything about his play style and the team's current situation indicate that he will have a great year with us but then again nothing last summer indicated he would have as little an impact as he did.

* You're smarter than you think you are and you have plenty of skills. That much is obvious to me.
* The good jobs are definitely out there for those with the skills needed, just market yourself more aggressively. Cold-call companies and ask them for a job, use any contacts you may have, apply for any position as soon as it comes up. Put up your profile on sites like Reed Recruitment (mate of mine just got headhunted for a 30k job straight out of uni with a 2:1 for a software dev job at a major accountancy firm). Be pushy, even if you get rejected call them back after a couple of months and try again. Squeaky wheels get the grease.
* Look for less obvious opportunities in industries you might not have considered. Banks, accountancy firms, tech companies, manufacturing - look at where business is booming in the economy and dive in there. You'll probably have to be prepared to move, but it's worth doing so for a good job.
* Consider starting your own business if you have a good business idea.

true,JamesR8800,eu,European Union (UK),"2:1 Law degree here. My first job out of uni was delivering Indian food, then a month later it was a 6 week stint in the Thornton's call centre at Alfreton, which in turn led to me getting a job as a claims handler in a call centre in Chesterfield, where I stayed for two years. All it feels like I got out of that was a terribly destructive relationship, a lot of crap from customers, and a salary which barely kept me afloat. But those two years in a call centre got me a job as a quality auditor for a more reputable insurance company in Leeds where I've been since March. Later this year I'll be starting my first insurance qualification and angling myself into more definite compliance role. I'm 25 now, and it feels like it's been a very long and hopeless road, but I might be starting to get on track. I have no savings, I live in a shared house, but I'm earning enough now that with a little discipline I could start saving for a deposit on a cheap house. I'm going to save for that deposit, buy my cheap house, then I'm going to flip it and have money for the first time in my life, even if it's only a few grand. In the meantime, I just finished the first draft of my first short story, which is something to give me hope that I might have a vocation I actually enjoy someway down the line. Or at least a hobby. I feel stuck for other reasons, very stuck (that destructive relationship I mentioned...) but at least now things are on track. My message for you would be to not give up, to keep putting one foot in front of the other, and not to lose hope that things will get better. Even a crummy job in a call centre can lead somewhere better.

In my opinion, what Luiz didn't realize was that the Brazilian defense wasn't properly compensating for his movement, in terms of shape (holding offside lines, dropping off/stepping up), marking (both opponents and space), and 1v1 situations.

My girlfriend had loads of high marks during GCSEs and a levels but then did an Animation and VFX degree but decided during her final year she she hated that industry and wanted to be a London Bus driver, instead and randomly applied to Arriva London as it's was one of the top google results (abellio are Crap :p) and got the job straight away! She was one of the few people on her course to end up with a job to goto after graduation.

She absolutely loved london bus driving, money was pretty good too lol, but lots of people in her garage kept telling her not to get stuck driving forever end up still be driving 20 years down the line and lots of her colleagues said a young girl in her early twenties could do better, they kept encouraging her to go for higher up roles at Arriva. In the end she applied for an internal vacancy and is now doing graphics for Arriva Trains but still drives rail replacements now and then!

Lol dunno why I rambled on so much but I guess it was that there are good cases out there of people with soft degrees eventually finding good things! 

And even going for a job some people may not want to do can end up somewhere better later on, Arriva regularly have loads of internal vacancies, their empire across the uk is pretty big!

true,jahoooo,null,null,"This is not about the UK - it's about you! So first off, stop blaming the ""recession"" and put your shit together. You think 8% unemployment is bad? How about 20% to 40% which does exist in some regions of the EU? I'm from outside the UK and believe me when I say that some eastern European countries would love to be in the economic situation you're calling a recession.

There is a huge amount of people, with degrees, brains and skills, who come to this country, leaving their friends, families and the environment they grew up in, to work way below their qualifications, because it's still better than trying to make a living in their country. Think about it for a second. 

Another thing is that you're only 23. You have plenty of time to make up your mind about what do you want to do for living. You are a native English speaker and you have a degree. This already puts you in about a top 15% of the UK population. That's right you're in about 15% of the elite workforce in this country, and to remain unemployed you'd have to be at the bottom 8%. As you can see the statistics are hugely in your favour.

Now before I provide you with some advise, let me tell you a short story. When I first came to the UK I was 24 and I had £10 in my pocket. I travelled from London to Manchester in a train's toilet because I couldn't afford a ticket. I stayed with my friend on a small room in shared accommodation for the first few months. 

Despite having higher education from my country I had to take any jobs just to pay the bills. I worked at factories, warehouses, hotels and even at a garbage damp. Doing 12 hour shifts, night shifts, occasionally working 7 days a week. Sometimes I had to be at a work agency at 7 am, with my safety shoes in hand, waiting in a queue for a shift that might or might not become available on that day. I had some of the most ridiculous jobs imaginable, requiring no brain whatsoever and I worked with people I had absolutely nothing in common with and nothing to talk about with. I hated every hour of every day in most of the jobs I had. I drunk a lot, daily. I had both a depression and a addiction problem. 

But I made it through.

Fast-forward 6 years and I am now a highly skilled professional, with a job I genuinely enjoy, flexible working conditions, good perspectives for the future, earning above national average and generally doing well to say the least (and not living in London).

Now for the advice:

1. Put your shit together. If you have a drinking problem or you smoke too much weed - give it up. If you watch too much TV or spend too much time on reddit - stop. If you have a depression - see a psychologist. If you're fat - improve your diet and start working out. Get organised. Get some good sleep. Set some goals and start working towards them.

2. Get a job. Any job, because if you have to worry about paying bills you won't be able to focus on more important stuff. It can be a part time job, or a temporary job, just something that will get you an income. If you have to live with your parents - fine. It's temporary. You're 23. Tell them you need to put your stuff together and have to stay at their place for a few months, but you have a plan. I'd expect nothing but support from them. Don't get into debt - it's the worst thing you can do.

3. Find out what do you want to do. See a counsellor, browse job boards, talk with people. Think about where would you like to be in 5 years. Set small goals, go one step at a time.

4. Get a decent CV. This is really important and it's easy to get wrong. You want to be able to sell yourself as just the right candidate for the job without lying. You need to know which skills to highlight and which details to leave out, depending on the position you're applying on. Get a book on writing CVs or have one written by a professional. If there are any qualifications that would make you a better candidate (certifications, courses, experience) get them. Practising interview skills is also a good idea.

5. (Optional) Think about getting a partner. Everything is just easier with another person you can rely on. It may motivate you, make you feel happier, give you new ideas. Now, I understand it's often easier said than done, but, you know, just start thinking about it. Maybe go out more often, go on a date with a girl you like. Perhaps just find a friend you can talk with and get some advice from.

6. Be patient. Don't be discouraged by failures, as there will always be some. Think long-term. You still have a lot of time and room for mistakes. Remember you live in one of the richest countries in the world. You're young, well-educated and you have your family and friends with you. The world is yours.

Good luck.
