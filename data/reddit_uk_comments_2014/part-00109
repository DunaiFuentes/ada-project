The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and you will be commended. For the one in authority is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for rulers do not bear the sword for no reason. They are God’s servants, agents of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also as a matter of conscience.

true,jsquadron,null,null,"If you choose to go to Loughborough, I'd advise you stayed in halls for your first year but try to choose a self-catered hall. Nothing more annoying than rushing back from lectures to meet lunch times. On average, most of the self-catered halls work out pretty much the same as a private accommodation(e.g waterways) depending on what you go for. I'm assuming since you're a first year student, it'd be quite hard for you to get a place from a private landlord since they usually want a group of people to let the whole house to.

- So a 39 week contract in halls would equate to a 50 week contract with a private landlord if the landlord decides not to give you free summer rent. (This is not applicable to you since you would be starting in September anyway.)
-
-If you did get a 39 week tenancy agreement from a private landlord, you'd be saving (70 * 11 = £770)* on accommodation. That figure is based on what I currently pay (all bills included).

If you could prove that the fee was paid for the purpose of moving the profits to another fiscal authority you would have shown that it wasn't incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade. In theory the whole of the expense might then fail to qualify for a deduction. In practice I would guess an adjustment for the excessive part is all that might be applied.

Part of the problem is actually proving that that's why you paid that amount. That's why I included the gold example. You paid for gold at a hugely over-valued price, why? There could be a legitimate reason. Maybe by doing so you secured a long-term advantage. (Arguably some of the cost might be capital in this sort of thing.)

People look at their government and see what has become a separate and impenetrable class of people, conducting themselves in offices that have no relevance to the common man, and who are entirely separated from the reality of his daily life by a wall of red carpets, of pomp and circumstance. Government and rule is by show. The decorations of state become a means of elevating the ruling class above the common man and beyond any accountability.

Man City - 86 (Need to beat West Brom, Palace, Everton, Villa and West Ham)

Looking at this we need to remember, Chelsea have europe still so will be less rested than us. Man City have a backlog so will be less rested too. Also to be recognised is that we only play one team fighting relegation, Chelsea play three and City play two.

If chelsea lose their next two and city draw their next two, while we win our next two, we win the league. Nevertheless, one match at a time is how we should be taking it now.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I find it odd....now, i think Lamela is probably still injured to an extent or at least unlikely match fit after this amount of time off the pitch and Sherwood (as usual) made a bit of a phrasing issue.  If Lamela isn't fit, then i don't have an issue with him not being on the pitch.

The thing that is odd to me is Tim's attitude in the media towards Lamela seems negative and the only rumors (granted rumors are just that, but can also give insight into what the overall attitude is behind closed doors) come out are fairly negative as well. How Tim doesn't like Erik, how he thinks he lacks (insert whatever here) etc.

Yet, Lamela seems to be the exact type of player that Sherwood (and McDermott) stressed with the youth team. Sherwood and the rest of the youth teams reportedly put a great deal of emphaisis on the young guys having the ability to ""dominate"" an opponent in 1x1 situations. Doesn't mean it is the only trait we look for (Kane and Carroll being examples) and doesn't mean they are aiming for a lineup with 10 Dembele clones, but means we put a priority on players who can win a 1x1 situation at a young age and develop the rest of the skills around that.

Well, Lamela fits that mold...he is someone who has the ability to beat someone 1x1, he has a solid shot, he can pass, his movement is solid....seems like exactly the type of player that someone like Sherwood would be drooling over in anticipation of developing him.  Yet, we don't even get rumors of this being the case the only rumors we get tend to be quite the opposite.

I want to see Lamela healthy and get a shot, but i don't know what the hell he did to Tim to get these snide comments and somewhat negative answers to anything about the kid.  Maybe Erik kicked Tim's dog, or dinged his car or doesn't listen to him....whatever it is, it seems like Lamela is not only hurt but in Tim's doghouse and it seems like he won't get out until we get a new manager.",0,1397748925,null,0,false,0,cguwb3g,t3_239npj,t1_cguwb3g,t1_cguvcj1,null,1433397645,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

true,orwellsocietyguy,null,null,"&gt; How about going to certain countries in the middle east where women aren't even allowed to show their bare arms or drive a car.

I don't think this is the argument though. If she said the UK was ""more sexist"" I'd be open to that line of argument, but she didn't actually say it. It's been pushed about but I think her point about it being ""in your face"" is valid. That's all I'm arguing for.

I've lived in the middle east and yes, there's some truly horrific behavior, but it's hidden away, it's behind closed doors and not in the public space. It's not ""in your face"". The burkas and walking behind the husband is all primitive and disgusting, but it's not heralded as a good thing - it's almost as though they know it's wrong. It's possible you get ass-hat preachers on TV putting women in their place, but you can turn it off or down and it goes away. 

I've often have to sit next to my extended family (usually the nan), contemplating suicide and watch some semi-clad, talent free, teenage lookalike, jut about on a ""talent show"" like she's having an epileptic fit and this is our prime time family entertainment. Ofcom even slapped a few wrists because it was overtly sexualised. If her criticism gets shows like that off the air we all win, society WOULD be better.

The UK is sort of unique in it's behavior of allowing the media to create overtly sexualized content and push it out there on to the streets. I'm not against Nuts and Zoo mag, but I don't want anyones 7 year old daughter seeing that at eye level in a supermarket, our entertainment industry is saturated with it and dominates the world - Miley Cyrus (do I really need to explain) is HEAVILY marketed at children along side padded bra's for 8 year olds, Keira Knightly is naked in bed pushing perfume on Kids TV and whilst it's a US thing as well, when it's combined with the other elements it creates a pretty bad picture.

Every time someone on here links to the Daily Mail and I click on it my skin creeps at the right hand column. It just doesn't seem to happen in Europe as much, maybe I'm wrong, but I'm always aware when I'm abroad by the lack of billboards and surfaces that aren't branded. I think the US is equally as guilty as we are. It's possible they could be worse.

London is the most branded city in the world and as they say ""sex sells"". It's become a part of our culture because we're so accepting of it. 

I think your right in saying she's confused objectification - I've heard women complain that they DON'T get wolf whistled at (because of a low self image) or been ecstatic at the fact they send men a bit crazy - even if they are on a building site. But that's because I think the British are unique in both their prudishness and their openness to criticism. 

Many European countries have far more prominent extreme right wing groups because we just won't put up with that sort of bullshit, even some of our more right wing and religious group leaders are accepting of gay marriage. But we're very divided on our attitudes towards sex and we have a strange relationship with it. The French, Germans, Scandinavians and Dutch all have us at the brunt of their jokes about how prudish we are and yet visit their countries and they don't feel the need to obsess over it so much or plaster it about the streets.

I feel the 800lb gorilla in the room is Japan. But that's another conversation.

Just quickly addressing a couple of points, while they're on my mind.

&gt;I have no issue with branding being billable for genuine franchises but you simply cannot franchise something to yourself. 

True, however, the Companies Act makes a company a distinct legal person. More or less each company is an independent entity. Where you have transactions between connected parties (which mostly means both under the same control or one controls the other) for tax purposes you have to adjust them to the arm's length value.

This gets you into the transfer pricing issues I mentioned. Part of the difficulty as I keep saying is the valuation. If we call them up and ask, ""If Sir. Robin buys a Ronnie of those beans from you, what's the price?"" more likely than not they won't sell them to us but if they do they'll say that that's the market rate.

(ODF was more or less: Tell us what you hid offshore, pay the tax, interest and a 10% penalty and we'll say no more about it.) Smith disclosed one account and tried to keep another eleven secret.

&gt;What they did as individuals is the same as what Starbucks is doing as a corporate entity i.e. maintaining accounts which they claimed were not connected to them. Why should there be a disparity?

No.

If you open three accounts with the Lloyds, one with TSB and half a dozen with Barclays they're all your accounts. If you register Sir Robin 1 Ltd and Sir Robin 2 ltd with Companies House the bank account of Sir Robin 1 is **not** a bank account of Sir Robin 2. In fact neither of their bank accounts are yours, even though you may be the sole director and shareholder in both.

&gt; Billing: they ""buy"" beans from a shell company in Holland, which fraudulently inflates the price so as to disguise UK profits, literally as you describe it in your Tippex example, the prices is specifically set to wipe out UK profits, there's probably even a direct correlation between their annual UK sales forecasts/costs &amp; the fake price paid for consumables. 

There is a fundamental and vitally important difference between buying at an artificially high price and tampering with an invoice. 

&gt;In an HMRC audit they will not accept this between me and my Ltd Co, all my costs have to be genuine. For example, if I work at home I cannot bill myself beyond market rate for the use of space or my power consumption. I cannot create a company in Luxembourg and sell myself floppy disks at £10,000 a piece.

No, you can't, but that's more because you lack the resources to manipulate the playing field. If you claim you bought floppy disks for 10,000 each the inspector of taxes will point out that they're a fiver for a box in WH Smith and will expect a pretty spectacular explanation if you're gong to dig yourself out of a hole.

But what if Brave Sir Robin Co (incorporated in Luxembourg) can afford to buy ALL the floppy disks in the world? Or what if you have a proprietary system that only accepts a particular media and the only place you can get them is Brave Sir Robin (Lux)?

Now you probably want to say, ""You plainly set that up to shift profits!"" Well, yeah that's exactly why I gave you those examples, but equally ridiculous transactions go on in real businesses all the time.

For example, no one would pay millions to Microsoft for extended support for Windows XP, when they knew for years that it was ending this month, right? Wrong. The government is paying Microsoft five and a half million quid for an extra year's support. And they're not alone in this. Is that a ridiculously high price? Yeah. Is it evidence of fiddling? Nope. (Chuck Tests!) (Just bad planning.)

Can you convince a Tax Tribunal judge that it's not legitimate? Maybe. But it's not as clear cut as your expensive floppy disks.

&gt; ""In order to commit fraud you must make a false representation that you know to be untrue or misleading."": this is not true for fraud claims. With financial fraud there are very rarely actual ""lies"", everything is reported exactly as it is.

How is this different from false representation?

true,lossaysswag,lfc12,,"Agger is left footed.  Playing centrally on the left as a left footed player is MUCH different than playing anywhere else on the pitch because generally you've *only* played on that side.  Sakho also would be very unlikely to switch to RCB.  Now, just think about the fact that both of them, as LCB can't just simply adjust to playing as LB a position that presents different responsibilities and challenges.

Also, you just supported my point.  Agger and Sakho, who could likely compete on talent and experience alone have virtually no chance at unhinging Skrtel from his RCB position and if Skrtel would go down neither would be looked at ahead of Kolo Toure to take over despite being much more solid at defending.

Borini was capable of playing at any of the forward spots *before* coming to Liverpool.

Henderson is a runner and a hard tackler, so putting him at RWB in a 5 ""defender"" formation out of necessity isn't much different when he's already drifting to the right and has experience playing as a right sided midfielder isn't much of an adjustment.

Switching sides isn't the same thing as completely switching roles, I don't know why you consider comparing the two.  Coutinho also played winger occasionally for Inter.  The only comparable switch (ignoring Gerrard) would be the emergency switches of Sterling and Henderson to wing backs, which only adds extra defensive duties.

You probably won't need any extra money, unless you have circumstances or a taste for a more expensive lifestyle.

I'm a second year Computer Science student in Teesside, I reckon I've spent less than £50 on alcohol in the last 2 years,  I haven't bought any books for university, but I have spent around £50 in the last two years on books for none-university subjects. 

It differs from person to person, but as far as I am concerned how much it costs me to live is really rent, food, transport, girlfriend and updating electronics every 2/3 years are my concern. 

Build an excel document with rent cost, bills, date and amount for student finance payment etc.. Then divide by the number of weeks you have between payments and make sure you NEVER go over. I'd recommend putting what you don't spend each week into a saving account and keeping it for the summer, traveling, deposits etc.. I saved £2000 of my loan last year, but only £1000 this year as I care a little more about what I eat and where I live. 

If your like me, you'll worry and plan alot before you get there, but when you actually know that your fine, you just get used to living cheaply and stick to that lifestyle. You think alot about it in the beginning, but when you get there most likely you won't need to think about it much.

true,C_arpet,null,null,"I can't claim that I wrote this:

The joy of victory, of vanquishing opponents not by shutting them out, but overwhelming them with thrilling improvisation.
The joy of belief, like a sudden shaft of spring sunlight, instantly warming the heart, pushing aside the memories of countless dismal winters, decades of grumbling hopelessness and wishful thinking.
The joy of belonging, the simple pleasure of sharing a glance with fellow fans, like we’re all in on some gigantic exciting secret.

But it’s a joy haunted by fear.

A fear that at any moment, we might wake up.
A fear that we might find the dream that had brought us such joy, such hope, dissipating from our minds like a morning mist.
A fear that months later, years later, we'll cast our minds back, and struggle to remember that glorious sensation, that golden age when we believed anything was possible.

Liverpool versus Manchester City was a tale of fear and joy.

For the first half hour, joy prevailed. 
We were fearless. Flowing.
Playing like carefree kids in the park.
A teenager has the coolest head of all, slotting home, in front of the Kop.
More pressure, roars and gasps, until a bullet header prompts delirium.
How we jumped and bounced and yelled with joy.

Buzzing, we look down from our heady clouds. 
And wonder at how high we really are.
And realise what a long way that would be to fall.  

Blue waves begin to threaten, we sense the gusts of a gathering storm.
The buzz of joy becomes a tingle of fear. 
How similar they feel, a pulsating throb in our throats. 
Close shaves endured, but we stand firm. Just about.

At last, half time. 
We blow out our cheeks, and wipe our palms dry. 
We nudge those beside us, smile and dare to dream.

When we return to the field, we know it’s out there. 
Somewhere. Waiting, lurking.
We hoped our joy would protect us, insulate us.
But fear was stalking us, ready to shock us with its sudden pounce.

Their first goal triggered a cascade of uncertainty and doubt. 
Fear does funny things to the limbs, it dizzies the mind.
Once we played like warriors, now we flounder like drunken clowns.
Five minutes of increasing anxiety culminates aptly.
We contrive to scramble the ball into our own net.

Now we look down, and realise what a long, long way it is to fall. 
How painful it will be to hit the ground.
When there’s no margin for error, it’s never just a football match.
It becomes a trial of character. 
Every mistake could be the one that brings everyone crashing down. 
The moment that destroys the dream.

Now it’s not about pressing and diamonds, or holding midfielders. 
Or tactical reshuffles and runs between the lines. 
It’s about overcoming the fear, the instinct to run and hide. 
The basic primal instinct to stay safe.

How do you fight the desire to flee?
Does a dressing room mantra spring to mind?
Or a psychiatrist’s counsel in a Teesside lilt.
That fear can never be dismissed, only mastered.

What if you discovered a magic ring?
What if when you slipped it on your finger, your every fear vanished.
Suddenly, where once were problems, now there are only possibilities.
You stop hesitating, and start being who you want to be.
Wouldn’t that be the most powerful artefact in the world?
Just imagine what you could achieve.
You could do anything.

A moment of bravery. Then everything changed.
A young full-back leaping in to win a header, when he could have stood off.
A Brazilian fighting for the loose ball, earning it with his determination.
A kid from Wembley driving forward, spreading jitters among the men in blue.

Because the funny thing is, fear doesn’t take sides. 
Fear stalks all equally. 
Perhaps its insidious influence scuffed the ball to the edge of the box.
The Brazilian wasn’t afraid that he’d miss. 
Courage enough not to demand another touch.
He trusted himself, and hit it instinctively.
And we lost ourselves in a glorious moment of redemptive bliss.

The game resumes, the ground in ferment. 
Our collective rush of joy corroded again by our nagging fear.
This is the time for brave hearts and resolute minds. 
Headers are won, desperate blocks are made. 
One too recklessly, and we’re a man down. 
Fear will do that.

At last, the whistle triggers an explosion of repressed emotion. 

This does not fucking slip now! 
This does NOT fucking slip. 
Listen, listen! 
This is gone. 
We go to Norwich. 
Exactly the same.
We go again.
Come on!

The leader exhorts: be brave once more lads.
Because the next game isn’t really against the men of Norwich City.
It’s against the doubts and anxieties in their own hearts.
Fear will be lurking at Carrow Road, waiting.
Each must face the anxiety of wanting it too much.
And the perilous complacency of not wanting it enough.
Disquiet mounting with every misplaced pass and wayward shot.
And suddenly we’re chasing a game we absolutely need to win.

We’re so high up now.
So close.
Such a way to fall.
How would we ever recover.

Were you ever this anxious playing footy in the park?
Can you remember those gloriously long summer days? 
When we just ran, and laughed and played.
Just for the joy of it.
There might be a lesson there somewhere.
I do hope in growing up, I haven’t forgotten it.
Because just imagine the awesome possibilities
Of a life without fear.

true,KopKopPlayer,lfc68,,"Since neither club has won a trophy this year, we can only talk about the future. In the very near future, Liverpool have a great chance to win the league and are almost a lock for Champions League football. Crystal Palace are almost a lock to avoid relegation. I'd give the nod to Rodgers there. 

Looking further ahead, Rodgers has made some smart purchases (Coutinho, Studge, Sakho, Allen) and has nurtured some rough-edged players (Sterling, Henderson) and will have a solid core for a few years to come. Pulis has brought in an average keeper, an average defender and an average midfielder who will do nothing to send them up the table next year. Of course, Pulis has only had one transfer window, but it's you suggesting he's already acheived more than Rodgers.

If you want to look at life without the managers, you could argue that Liverpool would be battling it for Europa league and that Crystal Palace would be almost certainly relegated. For Palace that means they would lose out on roughly £40m in PL money next year. For Liverpool that means we would lose out on roughly £30m in CL money plus whatever the difference in prize money would be between top of the table and mid-table (roughly £5-7m). So financially, they'd both be out of pocket equally more or less.

No! Happily this is fine in most pubs. If a place is weird about it its their problem, not yours, and you probably don't want to be spending time there anywhere. Good way to meet people too, sit at the bar earlier in the evening with a book and a J20 and you will find yourself getting to know the locals and the staff.

I live slightly north of where you will be, in Norwich and don't know that well Suffolk (although my grandma used to live in Beck Row, right next to Mildenhall, and worked on the base there).

Cambridge is a medium sized town, and quite well to do. You will certainly find a wider variety of pursuits there due to the large population of students. Obviously Cambridge is known for its prestigious University so you get a certain type of people in the area (aside from the students) whic hisn't a bad thing, just you will find that there is a very different standard of living there to say, Newmarket.

Personally, given the choice, I would live in Cambridge out of the three you list. Newmarket is a bit provincial, which might be your thing entirely but personally I would enjoy the wider range of cultural options tha cambridge gives. Bury St Edmonds is a beautiful old English town and these days I would probably be happy to live there but when I was younger (when I went to college especially) it was a bit quiet for my tastes. 

Can't really comment on Ely though as I don't think I have ever been.

Porn is racist, sexist and uses a lot of stereotypes because unlike other businesses, adult content producers have no reason to brand themselves as family friendly or to be sensitive to peoples backgrounds. It's a very private thing and nobody discusses it on a social level other than in jokes, therefore there's no social pressure on people to consume in an ethical way. 

Peoples fantasies also tend not to be very PC either, so naturally people will consume the porn that caters to their fantasies.

It's not something you can legislate or regulate away, and more to the point it's not a big enough problem to justify some idiot whining about it. Take a look at any country where porn is blocked/censored and look at their attitudes towards women. I guarantee that it's worse than here. On the grand scale of things it's a non-issue.

&gt;These remarks show a backward step for some in our society, in some cases rights that have been fought and argued for and won here a long time ago are being put into jeopardy.  The people put at risk by these courts are people who have been isolated from UK culture and language, and are brought up to respect these courts as being the true law.  These people (especially women) will be let down if we allow these courts to become the de-facto law in certain areas. 

1) They aren't courts
2) They aren't de-facto law anywhere

Our legal system allows in some situations for disputes to be settled through the use of a mutually agreed arbitrator, but arbitrators are not courts. The medias use of ""sharia courts"" is misleading as none exist. 

That isn't to say there may be some places where communities are disobeying/circumventing the law, and deferring to illegal internal settlements, but it's rare.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt; Porn is racist, sexist and uses a lot of stereotypes because unlike other businesses, adult content producers have no reason to brand themselves as family friendly or to be sensitive to peoples backgrounds. It's a very private thing and nobody discusses it on a social level other than in jokes, therefore there's no social pressure on people to consume in an ethical way. 

&gt;Peoples fantasies also tend not to be very PC either, so naturally people will consume the porn that caters to their fantasies.

I think that's a fairly good, concise summary, but it's also true that it creates, steers and shapes those fantasies.  The industry has not historically solely, nor even predominantly, been customer-led, it has been led by a fairly small club who've narrowly defined what porn should be and, according to a fair amount of research into how porn has shaped people's attitudes towards sex and sexuality, even at a relatively benign level, it's definitely increased the popularity of certain sexual practices, led fashions in bodily adornment/piercing, depilation, etc.

The internet and amateur porn have changed the game again, often to the good, occasionally for ill, so my position is not that we need to regulate or legislate away porn on the internet, but to tackle the industry globally, and the manner in which it exploits, abuses and discards people, exposes them to shocking working conditions, and eliminates their choices.

true,CEGRoberts,null,null,"I blame Roberto for the loss. The first XI was a poor choice in my opinion. McCarthy was injured, so fair enough that he didn't start. But playing Ross next to Barry simply didnt work. Ross was constantly looking for someone to make a run in front of him, usually himself. Not to mention playing Mirallas just off Lukaku was fruitless too. So tactically we were all over the shop right from the off. 

The more Deulofeu appears on the bench, the more money we have to play Barca, so I wasn't surprised he started. He's overrated, doesn't track back nor make vital final balls or threatening runs. 

Lukaku had a poor game, his first touch was often poor, not to mention he often made poor runs and was just out of sync with his assisting midfield. 

I would have had Osman next to Barry in the middle, with Ross behind Lukaku, Kev on the right and Aiden on the left. Aiden can beat a man and provided decent crosses in the first half. 

Defensively we were okay. Stones is proving to be incredible, and plays like a 30 year old. Cool head nearly all game, and commanded the boys from the back. 

We crossed the ball far too much in the first half, yet failed to use two of our greatest crossers, Baines and Coleman. They were pretty much non-existent all game. 

All in all it was a long time coming, but we could have and should have played better.

Suarez himself does that PLENTY.  Aspas is more of a point man.  He'll collect the ball with his back to goal and hold it up occasionally, but he's more likely than not trying to be on the receiving end of passes behind the defense.  Again, these are HIS words.  He doesn't feel comfortable outside of the #9 position.  Basically what you're saying is if Andy Carroll was still on the squad, he should be able to adapt to this system because occasionally other players' talents allow them to play outside their preferred role.  I think that should hammer (no pun intended) the point home.

In the rest of the games I have not played up front and this is very difficult. Where I exploded in the last two, three years at Celta was as a striker. I scored around 45, 50 goals.

The financial report delivered to UEFA is different then the public one we see covering overall finances since there are exceptions and such that UEFA doesn't care about.  This is one of the reasons it's so hard to predict FFP adherence (or lack thereof)- the information in the public reports doesn't really break out things like 'wages on youth players' which would be exempt from FFP.

That said, I would suspect any restrictions placed on a team would become public information.  UEFA are in the process of evaluating several clubs right now for adherence (notably City and PSG are thought to be in that pool).  As I said before, what UEFA does with 'violators' should give us some insight into how this will work next year for us if we are found to be out of compliance.  

Personally, I suspect UEFA will do very little.  Some clubs are threatening lawsuits against UEFA if they try to impose sanctions based on FFP and there is the very real threat of a pan-European breakaway league talked about by some clubs which would effectively destroy UEFA for all intents and purposes, so it's not in UEFA's best interests to try and come down hard on anyone.",0,1397758213,null,0,false,0,cgv12lf,t3_239c4u,t1_cgv12lf,t1_cgv06un,null,1433399954,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Have you never heard of Facebook? My deceased friend still has his page running, I have a little snoop and reminisce from time to time. It's sort of reassuring knowing it's still there, and seeing people drop by to post a bit of love now and then.

Tonight I was meant to be at a party but my stalker is going plus one other fella I'm not keen on seeing so now I am not. So the rest of the weekend involves sleep, reading, meeting three strangers from The Red Lion, films (I wanna see Raid 2), reading (American Psycho) and films on the computer (American Pyscho + lots of others). Did I mention sleep? A shit ton of it. And of course wine. I may pop down to Aldi and call /u/fidelcabro to talk me through what I should buy (if he's sober, which sounds unlikely).

My plan is as follows;

Pay off my debts (2K)

Max out a cash ISA with the best interest I can get whilst also allowing easy access and have it double as my emergency fund (5K)

Max out a stocks and shares ISA (6K), this I'm still hazy about because I don't quite understand what I will be required to do in order to maintain the account.

Put some into a P2P lending scheme (6K)

Put the rest into a standard savings account and trickle it into a monthly pay-in high interest savings account (6K)

Re-evaluate at the end of the tax year

From 7th to top 3 guaranteed is insane. Even if we don't win the league he should definitely win the manager of the year award. He knows how to man manage and is also incredibly good tactically. We have won so many games this season because he can see what isn't working and change it up straight away. Without a doubt we have probably run the most amount of formations and still won a lot. He also managed to get Daniel Sturridge who wasn't considered to be that good into arguably top 3 striker material in the EPL which is the most competitive league.

Wow.... what a fucking surprise!!!! You make bold claims that sexual assault on public transport is a common occurrence with only your word on it, and you expect us to accept that as fact? Can you see any logic in that?

I think the problem you have is mistaking a lack of believing your word as fact with a flat out denial that there's any issue. There is no correlation between the two. Nobody has denied that this doesn't happen, nobody has denied that it's not shit. What people are denying is that it is a common place occurrence which is accepted by our 
society. 

Please, by all means link to these forums which highlight sexual assault on public transport as being a serious issue affecting large numbers of the population at the very least.

&gt;you've disregarded by ""testimony"" but accepted your wifes? By the theory you're going with here your wifes anecdote should be equally irrelevant and therefore wrong.

Well done. You've finally figured it out.

I would never take one persons word to describe the nature of what is happening throughout the country.

&gt;You can't pick and choose, 

Funny, as that is precisely what you are doing. My wife is apparently wrong, and you are apparently right when you are describing the nature of a country this big.

I'm happy for you to show me something, anything to highlight how wrong I am in my opinion. But if I told you that sexually assaulting men in basketball courts was common without anything at all, why would you accept my words as fact?

And lastly, why the fuck would you expect anything to change if you keep it to yourselves? Because it's apparent we don't know it's happening, so how could we ever try to fix it?

&gt; I just can't see the parallel.

What I think has occurred is that you don't understand the point I'm making.

I was never arguing that they were entirely the same, but rather pointing out an example where (other) religions were granted a right, which was only held by one - the state religion- by the government of the day when the same argument could have easily been made at the time (If I went through Hansard again to research the topic as I did a while back then it's possible I might find something like that in there. Certainly the Bishop of Exeter had a few things to say on the subject both before and after). 

That's the key point. Remember that my comment was a response to an erroneous argument in the first place: that Muslims were somewhat trying to change the country, or gain privilege which others do not have, after having arrived from somewhere else.

I don't think there's really another specific (counter) example where another religious group isn't being granted or considered for the same treatment - i.e. No-one has stopped Christians from trying to get Good Friday off of exams - mainly because other religious holidays or similar aren't going to cause this sort of conflict. A unique case, perhaps. 

If you can think of one, I'd be interested in hearing it.

The state 'bending' towards religion in a circumstance where it accommodates a particular wish without any detriment to another group, discrimination etc. isn't really anything to do with a church/state divide or otherwise. To my mind it's akin to granting a group permission to hold a market on a Sunday, rather than a Saturday which is what the rest of the town does, because Saturday is their holy day and they don't do shopping etc. Not really detrimental to anyone (let's ignore trading restrictions, loss of earnings for x, y and z business for now...)",0,1397761162,null,0,false,0,cgv2l8v,t3_2370ow,t1_cgv2l8v,t1_cgv01gs,null,1433400670,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

A dictionary attack doesn't have to mean you literally use a dictionary against it. It just means you have a pre-prepared list of likely passwords to try.

Most half-decent password cracking software can automatically make common letter/number substitutions (eg. replacing l (lowercase ""L"") with 1). For some reason, many ""is this an acceptable password?"" systems don't do this.

With a set of rules like that, we can eliminate any words that aren't between 8 and 10 characters long and we can program the substitution so it never does a substitution on the first letter.

Granted, this won't work terribly well against Virgin's website - if their techies have a dozen braincells to rub together, they've already taken steps to block brute force external attacks (dead simple: block someone's account after a certain number of wrong passwords).

But if someone manages to get hold of a list of the hashed (=scrambled) passwords, a dictionary attack against that - which would normally be totally impractical - suddenly becomes very practical.

&gt;  considering the social interactivity and power the church wields in communities

This is all part of circular argumentation: We're a Christian country because we have Bishops in the Lords because we're a Christian country because there are lots of Church of England faith schools funded by the state because we're a Christian country because there are lots of churches running activities like Scouts and Guides because we're a Christian country because there are often ministers and reverends on local councils because we're a Christian country because we have prayers before meetings and Parliament because we're a Christian country because we've have a state religion that is Christianity because we're a Christian country because...

At what point would you say the church is no longer relevant, in so far as it should no longer have an automatic right to (26) seats (for men) in government or an automatic right to have its voice heard louder than everyone else? 

I'd say once we stop having a population that's majority christian/CoE followers (even though church attendance is shamefully low). 

&gt;why is it important that the CoE has a privileged voice in government?
Outside of any religious answer, it's because they fill a needed gap in local government that doesn't lend itself to an easily found replacement.  For example, rural folk who have issues can much more easily rally support from the local church, up through the higher ranks until the church appointed representatives speak those concerns to the government. If this wasn't available, then they'd have to rely on councils, a notoriously weak establishment.


&gt;To your mind, is there ever a time when they could not?

As I said before, once the population was no longer practicing or simply de facto Christians and CoE followers. Since the majority still favour church weddings, christenings and events, I don't see this happening in the near future.

&gt;PS - Purely out of interest, are you a practicing CoE? That won't mean I dismiss you automatically - it should be obvious that I have thought and feeling behind this and won't have to say ""Pish!"" and wave a hand at you. I'm just wondering.

I'm quite skeptical about a press law myself... I don't see the need.

As far as solutions go, the aim is to change the perception in the minds of people that if you get sent to court, you did whatever you were accused of. Even in the Nigel Evans case where it seemed reasonably clear that he didn't. I think education is the key. But that's a long term solution (it always is with education). I don't think a short term solution like a press law would help. Unfortunate things will have to keep happening in the meantime. There will always be bad things happening to good people, though.

&gt;I was not thinking of a specific case but rather a variation of ""mud sticks""

Well, we convict somebody to be guilty - which means that the jury is confident beyond reasonable doubt that they did the crime - or not guilty - which means that the jury is *not* confident beyond reasonable doubt that they did the crime.

That's entirely back into the circular argument though. I'm assuming you know the issue with the census question: ""What is your religion?"" and [the BHA campaign](http://census-campaign.org.uk/) to alter the wording to reflect the true state of religiosity in the UK? If you ask the question ""Are you religious?"" and compare it to the answer to the earlier question, you find a massive gap. Hence the term ""cultural Christians"". People say they're Christians because they assume they are because they're *told* they are and that they live in a Christian country.

You yourself would be counted by the [CoE in their attendance records](http://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/facts-stats/research-statistics/parish-attendance-affiliation.aspx) as a practicing member. But you're not, by your own admission above. Meanwhile only ~1/2 of all the people who answered ""Christian"" in the 2011 UK census [""believe that Jesus was the son of Yahweh""](http://richarddawkinsfoundation.org/). By what merit are those people Christians in the sense that the church should therefore hold sway over the lives of us all, particularly when it's possible that [~50% of us don't have any religion](https://humanism.org.uk/campaigns/religion-and-belief-some-surveys-and-statistics/the-british-social-attitudes-survey/).

I don't have a problem with the main meat of your article, it's just the ending and this attitude (that some fans and articles have) that we **must win** or else it'll all be for vain. You're right that winning the league **would** mean a lot and should we win, it would be a great triumph, but statements such as ""To win the league will restore pride not just to the club"" invoke a sense that we don't have pride as of yet, just as ""allow people to walk once more with their heads held high"" invokes a sense that LFC supporters *don't* already walk with their heads held high. 
 
I don't think it's wrong that we all want to win the league, just as much as the players do, and to be back in the limelight, but statements like those cause an almost entitled feeling.

Most interesting is your reference to ""strange language"". As explained my friend comes from another country originally. But he has daily dealings with the sort of bigots who push this agenda, and they are all from other countries originally. I struggle to think of any that are born here.

So to explain your pigeon hole, yes, I figured you yourself probably aren't in this sort of situation where you are daily dealing with immigrant populations, most of them muslims. That's all really. You haven't disappointed me. Am I wrong?

See, I sympathise wich the position you're trying to adopt. It's actually commendable and very British, in a sense. Good old fair play and all that. But oh, if you could only see how wrong-headed we have all become on issues like this. Granted, as I said, this particular detail may be getting blown out of proportion, but in general, if you would just apply your fairness consistently across the board you would be fine and I would be with you. The problem comes when we bend over so far we become unfair out of a motive of commendable tolerance.

And really, think about it. Here we a have a demand for exam schedule accommodation of ramadan which doesn't even get made in the Pakistan most of these muslims come from.

true,j_sunrise,river,River,"Ich probier's mal auf Deutsch:

Madame Kovarian stellte eine Falle auf. In ""A good man goes to war"" kam der Doctor, um Amy und Melody (=Baby-River) zu retten. Das Baby war aber nur ein Flesh-Doppelgänger. Der echte Körper von Melody war bei Madame Kovarian und diese hat dann die Verbindung von Melodys Gehirn zum Flesh Doppegänger gekappt. Das Flesh ist geschmolzen (Jelly-Baby-Insider-Witz). (Der Film ""Surrogate"" beruht auf dem selben Prinzip - sehenswert)

River hat dann allen erzählt, dass sie Melody ist. Der Doctor hat Amy und Rory versprochen, nach Melody zu suchen und River hat sie nach Hause gebracht. Der Doctor hat Melody nicht gefunden, River hat das natürlich gewusst, es ihm aber nicht gesagt und ihn trotzdem suchen lassen. 

Inzwischen wurde Melody in ein Kinderheim in den 60er gesteckt (""Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon"") und nebenbei zu einer Killerin ausgebildet. Sie konnte schließlich enkommen. Landete irgendwie in New York und regenerierte (Timeline etwas unklar). Sie nannte sich dann Mels und schaffte es irgendwie ins Schottland der 90er wo sie mit ihren nichtsahnenden und gleichaltrigen Eltern aufwächst. 

Amy und Rory machen einen Kornkreis mit dem Schriftzug ""Doctor"". Der steht dann auch prompt mit der Zeitung vom nächsten Tag in diesem Kornkreis. Melody gesellt sich dazu und zwingt den Doctor mit vorgehaltener Waffe, nach Berlin 1938 zu reisen. dort wird sie von Hitler angeschossen und regeneriert zu River.

**Also, um deine erste Frage zu beantworten, sie haben es versucht, mehrmals. Das Schicksal meinte es halt anders.**

Fake death? Welchen meinst du denn. Der kleinere wär der, als die frisch regenerierte River, versucht den Doctor umzubringen und es schließlich mit Gift schafft. River (bzw. noch hat sie sich diesen Namen noch nicht verdient) sieht, dass der Doctor noch versucht ihre Eltern und sie zu retten und anscheined eine gewisse ""River"" ziemlich liebt. Davon beindruckt beschließt sie, ihn mit der Energie ihrer restlichen 10 Regeneration wiederzubeleben.

Der größere Fake-Death ist der in ""Impossible Astronaut""/""Wedding of River Song"". River Song, die bereits Jahre älter ist als in ""Let's Kill Hitler"" wird von Madame Kovarian gefunden und gezwungen in einen Raumanzug zu steigen, um in beim Lake Silencio zu erschießen. Sie will die Zukunft ändern, mit weitreichenden Konsequenzen, alles stürzt zusammen. Also muss sie es noch mal durchleben, ihn diesmal aber umbringen. Zumindest soll es so ausschauen als ob. Der Doctor steckt nämlich in einem Teselecta, einem Robotor mit Mini-Menschen drinnen.  Er überlebt. River weiß das und muss alles später von der anderen Seite aus anschauen und kann nichts dagegen tun, weil sie weiß, dass es so geschehen muss; sie hatte es ja aus erster Hand miterlebt.

This allowed the British East India Company, to ship tea from India and still sell it at a cheaper price in the Americas than tea that had been grown locally, driving the local businesses and growers out.

This outraged the local businessmen when they felt that The Company (as it was known back then) was given more representation in Parliament than they were and that this whole tax situation was unfair, they felt all the taxes should be equal, or at least they should have a fair say in what taxes they have to pay.

So a group of people went onto ships owned buy The Company, and destroyed the tax free tea.

I definitely wish I'd lived in halls, simply because I'd know far more people. In my first year I ended up in a house with 6 international students who were all on a one year course, and left at the end of the year. I'm now in my third year and only two people that I know are 'still here'.

I'm not a particularly outgoing person and can't stand any of the student clubs, so it's my opinion that halls are *the* best way to meet new people - once you're out of first year people have settled into their friendship groups and it gets harder to meet new people, at least in my experience anyway.

Sorry, this has turned into a ""boo-hoo poor me type thing,"" but the message from me is **go into halls**, it may be more expensive but that'll be worth it as you'll meet so many more people.

Since it doesn't make sense to have a few people working crazy hours while everyone else is unemployed, the typical working week has gradually reduced to ""share out"" the available work.

We aren't going to suddenly all switch to 4 day weeks tomorrow, it would be too disruptive. But what if, say, the government gradually increased the minimum amount of statutory holiday, over the course of a couple of decades. But in exchange, they gave employers more rights to determine when employees take the extra days. Eventually, everyone gets 72 days off a year but they are told this has to include taking every Tuesday (or whatever) off.

Ok, I appreciate that you already left so you probably don't know.  These things are the hallmarks of phoenixism.  Basically collapsing one business and starting it up again to dump a pile of debt.

When I say dumping debts what I mean is basically tax debts.  When this happens companies tend to pay their suppliers, because not paying them tends to dramatically lower their willingness to sell you stuff.  If that's what we have they probably paid you not realising you'd already gone and they could have just screwed you over.

I'd recommend you explain that as far as you can see you were paid for work done ask them to lay out in writing the precise circumstances where they believe you owe them money.

The most important dos and don'ts would be to try not to be too loud and obnoxious, especially when it comes to boasting about American traits or complaining about British ones (feel free to do both, just be sensitive). Also don't be afraid to try out new things while you're over here, you'll find that although we share a language the cultures are entirely different, and worth exploring. I'm guessing you're already prepared to do these things though or you wouldn't be choosing to come over here.


Every town in the UK is different, and I don't really know how to explain it to you as well as you will actually be able to experience it when you move. British towns and cities have very curvy, inefficient and sometimes frustrating road and one-way systems compared to most of America. We often rely on public transport just as much as our cars, depending on how the transport is for your area. We have a massive drinking culture, and I don't want to pressure you but you will probably feel a little left out if you don't drink (but don't feel forced into doing it just to fit in).

To implement something like this there are so many things to consider, most importantly wages.

For example, Let's say you are working 40 hours a week for £10 an hour. That's £400 a week. If full time hours were reduced to 30 hours a week (6 hour a day). Then the hourly wage has to increase to £13.33 to earn the same amount. If the wages do not increase, then you still have to work 40 hours a week, so only if the wages rise can this happen. ALSO importantly, many disregard this, but you must see in the point of view of the employers. Many businesses may be able to afford it, but there are many that are already struggling so it may be very hard on them. This might mean letting workers go if they can't cut costs somewhere, which means higher unemployment.

Also there is also the problem on inflation. It seems counter intuitive to think that reducing the number of hours will increase unemployment, but depending on the economy different things can happen.

No, it really doesn't. I don't think I've met anyone serious who denies that women are given priority in custody disputes. There's a reason why some fathers are climbing up buildings and setting themselves on fire because they can't get access to their children. There's no ""mothers for justice"" group (in that sense) because they don't need one. 

&gt;it's kind of hard to compare how the system treats male and female victims

Again, the stats I've seen are pretty clear. For the same crime, women receive substantially lower sentences than men, on average 50% (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/220081/statistics-women-cjs-2011-v2.pdf) If you have any evidence otherwise, I'd be very interested to see it. 

&gt;There are lots of men's rights sites insisting that divorce rulings systematically favour women, but every non-MRA site I have found presents a far less certain view.

Ok, this one is a bit more debatable, but generally divorce courts are seen as more female friendly, perhaps that's why women are much more likely to initiate divorce (66%) despite also being (slightly) more likely to be the ones who cheat. 

&gt; I'm not aware of any big gender disparities as far as the pupils are concerned

As I've already posted, not only do women dominate teaching (88% in primary school) but perhaps not by coincidence girls now outperform boys at every level of education from primary right through to university. You'd have to believe boys are just born stupid not to realize there was something odd going on there. 

So clearly, there are some areas in which males are disadvantaged. I think you'd have to be pretty obstinate not to admit that.

If you went to Saudi Arabia you'd see women driving around in cars and people openly beeping them in support. Blogs are alive with women supported by tens of thousands of people encouraging them. The media support them - openly. The general public are behind women driving. SA has a higher number of women in education that the west and many stats that actually put us to shame. Women's rights are making a huge breakthrough in a place where there's terrible oppression of women. Yes - it's worse, but it's not openly promoted by a willing population on the world stage.

What you don't see is huge billboards saying ""women can't drive"". You can't just compare that society with ours and then say ""they're worse, so we're all good"". SA is a BAD place for women, but the general public live in fear of authority and do as they're told as a result - you hear stories of the ""beard police"" that drive around in SUV's looking for trouble. Female repression is acceptable even to women as they haven been emancipated - there's been no sexual revolution there. Don't hold that up as a mirror to our own society.

&gt; they had a segment on a TV show I was watching in mid-afternoon, which focused primarily on filming topless girls in thongs on the beach.

You're taking something out of context. Name a single French girl band that are world famous for strutting about the stage in flimsy outfits and are aimed at teenage girls. You can't. There's a ton of them in the UK - in fact act's like ABBA came to the UK to be famous in the first place. The UK dominates the world in the music industry. It puts the rest of the world to shame when it comes to a tiny land mass owning the worlds media stage. 

Brands from all around the world use UK advertising agencies to promote their goods and our entertainment industry is skewed well out of proportion to the rest of Europe. Look at the worlds biggest selling acts - U2, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Metallica, Iron Maiden etc etc. I could go on. This is all from an island that is 4 times smaller than California and yet the total revenues from those acts represent a huge majority of the entire planets music revenues. Where are the women? Well... they're in the songs like ""take your daughter to the slaughter"". If guys want to sell millions of records they strap on guitars and blare out powerful messages. If women want to sell they take of their clothes and sing about getting fucked by men. There's no male equivalent of ""Bootlyicious"". Guys don't dress up in sexy school boy outfits and ""do a Britney"". There's no lesbian equivalents. Sure you can point to individual exceptions, but the vast majority of music industry output is hetrosexual, male dominated role play. Madonna was big because she broke that role. The Spice Girls sent the whole thing running back in to the kitchen shouting ""zig-a-zig ahhh!"".

You can't compare the worst place in the world, hidden from sight and only ever appearing in news reports and say that because women are treated like shit that this is an equal to the worlds most progressive, open and fair society with a voice that's more powerful than any other in the world. It does an injustice to your argument.

Wages would have to increase to retain the amount of demand in the economy, hence why when there's mass unemployment and low wages, the economy suffers because peoples purchasing power decreases. If companies want to survive, they will, in general have to increase pay which eventually filters through to their profit.

If it was up to capitalists we would be working every day in the week, with no weekends, holidays, breaks, and certainly without an 8-hour day. All of which were achieved by the international militant self-organisation of workers, all achieved in their struggle. The fact is if humans actually controlled their own lives and weren't subordinate to the dictats of capital, forced to spend the majority of their waking lives in menial, monotonous, hateful jobs, then we would have already reduced the work load if not eliminated work altogether from society (that is work as a separate sphere of activity). The fact is since the 1960s productivity has increased beyond measure, technology has given us the ability to produce with little effort, in a society controlled by humans that should have reduced the amount of work, but in a society organised and regulated around the insatiable and infinite demands of capital, there is never an end....there's never enough, 'the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe'.

true,_gilb_,king,,"Tim Sherwood will resist any pressure to play Erik Lamela this season after he reiterated that Tottenham Hotspur’s record signing was ruled out for the rest of the campaign.

Lamela hopes to return to training next week after four months out with a back injury and Tottenham are keen that the midfielder plays after a season dogged by injury and difficulty in settling at the club. There might be further embarrassment if Lamela does not play again this season but travels with Argentina to the World Cup finals. Tottenham are also concerned about his valuation should they decide to try to sell him back to Roma this summer.

Lamela was signed for £30 million from the Italian club to replace Gareth Bale, but has become a pawn in the power struggle at the North London club. Sherwood is likely to be replaced as head coach this summer and has laid blame for some of the club’s problems at the feet of Franco Baldini, the technical director, who spent nearly £56 million last summer on Lamela and Roberto Soldado, the striker who has also struggled to settle.

Sherwood said: “No, there’ll be no chance Erik’s fit. Someone told me that the hierarchy here are asking for him to get more opportunities. Chance would be a fine thing, he’s injured.” Sherwood said it was wrong to label Lamela a flop because injuries had restricted him to three league starts and six appearances as a substitute.

“He’s still an unknown quantity,” he said. “I’ve got my ideas on who is capable and probably who is not in the squad and Erik . . . the jury’s still out on him because I haven’t seen enough of him, so he’s been very unfortunate. It is unfair [to call him a flop] because obviously he has not been fit, so it has been hard to judge. He comes with a huge price tag, but it is not Erik that sets that price.”

The deal looked more costly after Bale scored a brilliant solo winning goal for Real Madrid in their 2-1 Copa del Rey victory over Barcelona on Wednesday night, leaving Sherwood to claim that Tottenham would have been challenging for the title had the Wales player not been sold last summer.

“He scored 21 goals and nine assists last season, he scored a winner in eight of our games and we could do with him now,” Sherwood said. “If you put those on top of what we’ve got, we’d probably be challenging for the title. The two best players on the pitch for Madrid [on Wednesday] were Gareth Bale and Luka Modric [also sold by Tottenham], and that says everything.”

Sherwood feels that the £85 million Tottenham received for Bale should have been better used in the transfer market. “You always look for blend and we need different types of midfielder for instance,” he said.",0,1397777649,null,0,false,0,cgvajuk,t3_23b5hz,t1_cgvajuk,t3_23b5hz,null,1433404488,41,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,41

&gt;

&gt;The __quality-adjusted life year__ or __quality-adjusted life-year__ (__QALY__) is a measure of [disease burden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_burden), including both the quality and the quantity of life lived.   It is used in assessing the value for money of a [medical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical) intervention. According to Pliskin et al., The QALY model requires [utility independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility), [risk neutral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_neutral), and constant proportional tradeoff behaviour. 

&gt;The QALY is based on the number of years of life that would be added by the intervention. Each year in perfect health is assigned the value of 1.0 down to a value of 0.0 for being dead. If the extra years would not be lived in full health, for example if the patient would lose a limb, or be blind or have to use a [wheelchair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair), then the extra life-years are given a value between 0 and 1 to account for this. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Under certain methods, such as the EQ-5D, QALY can be negative number.

Fans of other clubs, particularly Everton, have been a class act these past few days. Like you say, things like that put all rivalries to one side and allows everyone focus on what's really important. Liverpool fans have had a rather bad rap over the past 25 years for 'banging on' about HIllsborough and finally over the last year or so it's become clear to the wider world that the families who fought for justice were right all along. As your brilliant manager said the other day, the people responsible for the cover up took on the wrong city. Christ, I never thought I'd have so much admiration for an Everton manager. You'ev got a good'un there, he'll bring you so much more success than Moyes ever did.

Like you, I was raised to absolutely hate the other club on Merseyside. I'm not from Liverpool but I've always hated Everton and United in equal measure...but honestly, I can see what people mean when they say that Everton are an alright club apart from 180 minutes a season. The club's been full of class and I've gained a lot of respect for you all recently.

I have spoke to official members of parliament and they tell me that the rise in meth usage is a huge issue, but it's something that tends to be kept away from international eyes and parliamentary hearings. I also know that there are a large numbers of meth rehab clinics in my town, and all across Victoria. It's also the reason why there is a methadone program (heard of it?). The methadone program is basically a way for the government to pay for a safe high to get them off meth, off the street and ween them off completely. I read in a statement by the Pharmacy guild that there are more people on the methadone program, than on a contraceptive program, which is nice. Just because you close your eyes to the issues around you doesn't mean they don't exist.

Secondly, the influx of Chinese into white suburbs is real. I doubt these names mean anything to you but Box Hill and Springvale are two examples. Two formerly white and European suburbs whose councils both stated last year that the Chinese population is over 90% , rising from the last 10 years. I live in a pretty white suburb called Frankston. Last week I saw a bus full of Chinese people, with a tour guide, and they were telling them about how to go about buying streets of houses and units at a time. Even Bruce Billson the MP for Small Business said that there is a real issue with Chinese people with dirty money, buying a ton of property, and renting it out whilst they still live in China, and keep away from the law. I find it extremely racist and disgusting what is happening to the white population, but typically you don't care because why? we're white? Absolutely disgusting, as a victim of racism, where I have been told that Chinese people want to buy the row of houses I live on because it's almost like the Nazi's or the Zionists. If you want to support good people getting driven from homes and suburbs because they're white, good for you, you sick racist. 

tl;dr This meth epidemic is real, every fellow Brit i've met over here it's always the first thing they bring up. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it's not real, get out your ivory tower. Also it's just a fact that Chinese are buying out property and full suburbs, stating facts isn't racist, but driving white people out of homes is.",0,1397779351,null,0,1397779565,0,cgvbalx,t3_238o93,t1_cgvbalx,t1_cgvantp,null,1433404839,0,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,0

not it wouldn't. You fail to recognise the interconnectivity of the economy and the cycle of capital. It would in fact make little difference (which was the historic case), since if every service in the country went up who is it going up for? Partly for workers, if business increase their profit by 25% workers’ wages will increase, in fact must increase because the cost of living has increased 25%. 

Remember that the wage paid to workers is also the wage that buys goods, if you reduce the wage you reduce the consumption of goods and thus the profit of your business (one of the many contradictions of capitalism in fact). If prices went up 25% relative to prices demand would go down massively and business would in fact be forced to lower prices to gain sales, you assumption is that the profit margin (or surplus value) is always the same proportion, in reality capitalists attempt to get as much as they can, if they could increase prices by 25% today and get away with it they could, but they can’t and they wouldn’t be able to in the future even with a 4-day week. The wage is broadly determined by the cost of workers reproducing themselves (i.e. living in a society, their social needs) in relation to the reserve army of labour and the market. Actually as the market equalled out the main loser would he profit, hence why people are so quick to dispel this idea, for all the proclaimed greatness of this organisation of society we have never worked so much in history as we do now.

What would change is 25% less work would be done, I would argue that this isn't a bad thing since most of those jobs are unnecessary and known so by their employees (call centres for examples, the largest employer in the UK) – As this survey shows is things could remain broadly the same but one day of work was replaced with one day of leisure, people would support it, but instead the bogeyman must be employed ""the economy will collapse"", ""earth will end"" wahwahwahwah..(the same as when the 8-hour day was proposed and the minimum wage)

Throwing money into the training ground, stadium, improving infrastructure is fantastic. Throwing money at the playing staff with no idea how to regulate it means little.


The club had a **financial** plan when Lambert was appointed. They didn't have a football plan at all. Each manager that has come in under Lerner has had a totally different vision for Villa which means every time our manager leaves, we have to start all over again. There is no continuity.


Lack of football knowledge is a **massive** issue, not because Lerner doesn't have it, but because he is totally unwilling to appoint people that do have it to help him out. The people that are involved in 'that sort of stuff' right now don't have the necessary knowledge. And that is down to Lerner's recruitment policy. If he was willing to shake things up and make the necessary changes then that would be great, but year after year the media, ex-players, fans call on him to do it and he completely ignores them.

I disagree that transfers and appointments have been an issue. Every club makes good signings and bad signings and we're just the same. O'Neill was a good appointment, Houllier not so much, McLeish was terrible. I like Lambert, I know you don't so let's not go into that.

I agree with the continuity issue. We do need a consistent vision so we don't have to restart. It's one of the reasons I want Lambert to stay. But yes, ideally the vision would come from above and not renewed every few years.

I think the lack of football knowledge can be fine, as long as those below know what they're doing. The majority of Premier League clubs have clueless owners. Our problem is that we need to right people below.

I hate when people use statistics for players who play in different midfield positions, because most of the time it usually means nothing. How many assists does Modric have this season? Probably not very many. Does that mean he is average?  No, he has been the heartbeat of Madrid and heavily influences their style of play and has been one of the, if not the best player of their team.

Bayern Munich are showing an interest in Aston Villa prospect Easah Suliman.

The defender, 16, has captained England at Under 17 level and impressed Bayern's scouts playing in the FA Youth Cup.

Suliman, who is from Hall Green in Birmingham, has been with Villa since he was eight years old and was spotted playing in a tournament at Butlins.

He turns 17 in January and has shown versatility by playing at left back as well as centre back.

Bayern are continuing to scour England for potential talent as they did with Tranmere protege Dale Jennings. ",0,1397800625,null,0,false,0,cgvjml7,t3_23c51y,t1_cgvjml7,t3_23c51y,null,1433408831,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

Mads Bach Lund, agent of Aston Villa striker Nicklas Helenius, has said his client could be leaving the Midlands side in the summer after barely featuring under manager Paul Lambert since joining at the start of the campaign.

‘If, after the last few games in the Premier League he is told that he must find something else, then a club like Aalborg will be very interesting for Nicklas.’

Helenius, 22, has made just three substitute appearances in the Premier League for the Villains this season. The Danish striker joined from Aalborg BK for around £1.5M in the summer, but has only bagged one goal in his debut campaign - in the FA Cup third round defeat to Sheffield United.

He’s yet to make a start for Villa, and there has been the worry his time with the league strugglers is over. However, with the club having two of their strikers out for the rest of the season, there is a slim chance Helenius could feature in their remaining games.  

Finding himself an unused substitute on 17 occasions this season is stark contrast to what Helenius has been used to prior to the move - considering he’d scored 39 goals in 100 for his former club.",0,1397800751,null,0,false,0,cgvjnsb,t3_23c55n,t1_cgvjnsb,t3_23c55n,null,1433408847,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

If only humankind had invented some way to control the heat within buildings! Does anybody know of such a device?? Are you seriously suggesting that British weather is so hot that nobody can possibly concentrate? What about the other half of the world which is consistent hotter than our summers could ever be? Or are you seriously suggesting that children spend the entire of July and August outdoors?

Our term times were created around agriculture so that children could work in the fields. This is 100% irrelevant now.

And no, genius, re-read what I wrote. 4 days a week isn't reducing their teaching if you get rid of the big chunks of holidays. You can average out the hours in a much more sensible way. 

And the four day pattern was revolved around teachers and parents also working 4 days per week (ala the topic of this thread). Your point about lack of concentration is utter bollocks too - you just pulled it out your arse. I can just as easily pull something out of mine saying how kids have more frequent breaks and more consistency and so they can be focused for a higher % of the time. 

But in reality, kids can learn to toughen up.

&gt;must've been thought up by someone with that sort of attitude to school life themselves.

Gee, thanks for the personal attack. I can only assume someone with your attitude is a lazy teacher who is scared about actually having to work hard and not get paid for 8 weeks of holiday.

true,ShittyTeam,logo,,"Yeah, he played for City. From his wiki:

&gt; Aged 18, Busby signed for Manchester City on a one-year contract worth £5 per week on 11 February 1928,[3] with the provision for him to leave at the end of the deal if he still wished to emigrate to the United States with his mother. He decided to stay and made his debut for City on 2 November 1929, more than 18 months after first signing for the Blues, when he played at inside left in a 3–1 win at home to Middlesbrough in the First Division. He made 11 more appearances for City that season, all at inside forward, scoring five goals in the process.

&gt; During the 1930–31 season, City manager Peter Hodge decided that Busby's talents could be better exploited from the half-back line,[3] with Busby playing the right-half role. In his new position, Busby built up a reputation as an intelligent player and a finer passer of the ball.[4] In 1930, Manchester United made an enquiry about signing Busby from their cross-town rivals, but they were unable to afford the £150 fee that City demanded.[5] By the 1931–32 season, Busby was firmly established in the first team, missing just one match that season.[6] Indeed, Busby and Jackie Bray became such fixtures at wing-half that club captain Jimmy McMullan had to move to forward to keep his place in the team.[7] In the 1930s Manchester City performed strongly in the FA Cup. They reached the semi-finals in 1932, and the final in 1933 before finally winning the tournament in 1934. However, from the second half of the 1934–35 season, Busby's number 4 jersey was worn by Jack Percival with increasing regularity, and Busby was sold to Liverpool for £8,000 on 12 March 1936, having made more than 200 appearances for Manchester City.",0,1397805717,null,0,false,0,cgvkttn,t3_23bnqg,t1_cgvkttn,t1_cgvkhz6,null,1433409397,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

You sound like someone saying that we cannot listen to the opinions of people who have suffered racism because they are biased...they are biased because they have experienced the reality. Independent advice is worse since it assumes that people who have never experienced racism or sexism can talk authoritatively on the topic. Scientists are also biased when they talk about science. That's not to say 'independent' groups cannot do research or collect data, but the reality is that peoples experience is paramount, and once you state that we simply cannot include the experiences of people who  have suffered racism in a study of racism you tacitly support the forces of racism themselves. There are problems with mainstream groups in that they fail to understand how racism is reproduced, or the multitude of ways it is reproduced, for example the Game of Thrones TV series is playing an above average function in the drip drip of racial ideas.

Also I think your lying arguing antiracists groups would always exaggerate the amount of racism, they aren't a vested interest because they don't profit from it. Of course we can all read the reality of your comment; your opinions are rational and objective, whereas those of antiracist groups or groups against domestic violence are compromised. You evidently haven't thought about this if you're proclaiming the validity of statistics, which have a multitude of problems, like it or not anecdotal evidence forms the basis of most of our views and in many cases reveals what statistics do not - in fact statistics is perhaps once of the worst methodologies in attempting to delineate societies with structural racism (the funny this about this is anecdotal evidence is one of the ways some levels of racism are reproduced, and generally those who argue against it in one situation, live of it in another, the Telegraph for example mainly gets sales of anecdotal evidence). Funnily enough I'm writing about the myth of racial democracy in Cuba and Brazil at the turn of the century at the moment, a myth of equality that sought to hide a very unequal society, it's interesting how many comparisons I can draw between then and today, down to even the arguments used by proponents to defend that ideology.

There is in an organized event like a bike race.  You can put signs up warning other road users that there is a race occurring on that road, have a car head of the pack both to warn oncoming drivers and block off junctions  and finally you can have marshalls at dangerous junctions, blind corners and summits ensuring who has good visibility and can see road users (including the racing cyclists) coming from both sides and can take action when they see something dangerous about to occur.

There are all pretty cheap and relatively easy things to put in place if you're going through the effort of organizing a bike race anyway.

This wasn't some freak accident, it happened because of the lay of the roads and the way a pack of cyclists and traffic act.  All things that can be taken into account when doing a risk assessment.  And if you've done everything you can to make the road safe and something like this happens...maybe an alternate route should be considered.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt; Well that's just wrong. Even AS Level business studies will tell you that over-worked, unhappy employees means they will do shitty work. They also get sick more, quit more often and then you need to train their replacements.

The reality is though none of those things exist naturally, they were all fought for against capital. That said capital has adapted extremely well to the challenges it's faced. 

* there are those workers who do suffer this, in fact a large majority of the world’s workforce don't enjoy anything like the rights won by labourers here, or even in the west. The amount of intensity and rate of labour is determined by its content. Those sweatshop workers work 16 hour shifts, with little holidays, safety, pensions and so on because they have no organisation to defend them, and crucially they aren't producing what they consume, they are producing what westerners consume and thus are outside the circuit of capital. That said there are many workers like this in the UK also, take cleaning staff, in the final analysis when you have a large reserve army of unemployed it doesn't matter that your workers are over-worked, tired, unhappy (after all most workers are) and so on because if they don't do the job to the wishes of their employer they won't have a job - so this statement really depends on what type/form of work you refer to, that said no of the answers are good for workers. The same reason why capitalists can force workers to do a multitude of things they wouldn’t want to is the same reason why the wage relation exists at all, social dependency.

As for your response, you have to understand that the amount of work needed isn't an abstraction but rather is formed in market demands in a particular but always shifting context. What is required of workers is that they do the 'average' work. That is they work the same as everyone else. 

* The value of commodities is determined by the amount of *socially necessary labour time* needed to produce them - if in general all workers have the same productivity in a given sector, this work isn't 'shitty'. If **all** workers are, as you say, over-worked and unhappy, then it doesn't make a difference, there isn't shitty work because there's no non-shitty work, all competitors are shit and thus no competitors are shit, that is what it means to compete.

* the need to expand capital is the need to increase productivity. Henry Ford recognised the strong labour movement for a 8-hour day and calculated that it would be in his interests to not only decrease the working-day but increase pay, this wasn't calculated in what would be good for workers but rather how he could maintain profit. He did that by increasing the division of labour (in this case mass production) and turning workers more into robots, making their labour more abstract, less skilled and so on. Of course this advancement of the work process didn't remain unique to Ford for long; it was adopted in the evolution of capitalism forced by the struggle of workers. 

My point was that if you leave it up to capital to have its interests run and determine all the time and forms of labour, you really cannot predict what would be the result. After all in recent years we've seen the rise of informal work hours, that is work done outside the workplace setting, outside contracted hours etc. this has been brought about by technology partly. But what we cannot forget is capitalists, forced by competition, must always regulate and control their workforce to make sure they produce the most goods, in the least time, with the least cost, (that entails a massive bundle of contradictions and antagonism that can't be elucidated here).

The awesome thing about the current competitive scene, is on the scaling level of events and 'prodom' it's only the true high level that starts requiring you to give things up to compete, and on your journey to that point you'll be able to tell if it's worth it (Whether you have the actual talent to do so.). Most T2-3 teams (And some T1) are either in university or full time work.

On the other hand, you may be doing this for wrong reasons. If you're attempting to 'show' your parents that this gaming thing is OK, you're taking a route that will probably never pay off. Right now, up until the point that you're a pro (Or have the opportunity to be so), Gaming is a hobby. There is no real logical reason to see it as time wasted any more than sports, watching TV, or any other 'hobby' is seen as time wasted.

Of course the only way to find out if you're treating it more than a hobby (Which may be cause for concern) is simply asking yourself one question: Is your gaming time interfering with crucial life events? Are you financially stable, educationally sound, healthy with an overall forwards plan for the future? If not, is gaming negatively attributing to the situation?

who is this determined by?

presumably under this logic if we wanted to better educate our children we should increase the time they're at school...that is what they certainly do in parts of Asia (i.e. the awful night schools in South Korea). But again who determines these things, why should children go to school at all? Is it merely to get a job? The night schools of East Asia create massive amounts of depression, suicide, hopelessness and rebellion...just like reducing the workload of workers makes them happier I think we should reduce the workload of children. 

Of course what also needs to be questioned is the content of schools themselves, it isn't just about how much time they learn but what they learn. 

The same reason why lots of children hate school is the same reason why lots of adults hate work, it is a form of labour or activity forced upon them by some unseen exterior force, abstract labour they don't do because they want to or recognise the value in it, but because various social forces demand and coerce them into it. Those experiments with a different form and content of schooling, such as [Free Schools (in the old sense)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchistic_free_school) have proved remarkably effective in generating happy developed children with critical thinking, the fact is none of the education at present cares about those things (or if they do it's as means to an end), education is directed towards 'employability' the accumulations of 'qualifications' and so on, what we should really question is the role of education (just like work) in our society. This subjugation to the dictats of capital makes this topic, which you raised for a different issue, actually remarkably similar to the topic under discussion here in general. The question that comes to my mind is *'why can't we reduce the school week to 4 days?'* (the question that really springs to mind is why do we want to keep schooling or work anyway?) 

(– that said no solution emerges unless you recognise the causes to which you question, if when people exert their individualism and freedom capitalism ruins society, the response is **not** to deny that freedom and individualism, but to deny and negate capitalism – when society refuses you the right to live, you must take it.)

The problem in having capital dominate our lives is it determines, not us, what is useful and necessary to create and advance, what's profitable is what is made...human reason, critical thinking and empathy are **not** the basis upon which decisions are made about intellectual and technical investments. 

I am quite willing to believe not only would human need for advancement ensure technological grow, but that humans are quite willing and able to collectively and rationally debate what kind of advances and changes they need or wish to see instead of having them dictated by the dictats of 'profitability' - if you accept profit as the reason for activity then you justify the deaths of millions of people, because the impoverished are ignored by capital (since they have no money to spend) - you either accept that or you apply other criteria to the situation, i.e. empathy or morality and so on which implicitly negates capitalist market relations.

Di Maria is a player that is meant to influence play in the final third. If statistics don't portray his quality then nothing does. If it was someone like Lampard who is CM then I would agree that stats don't matter, simply because someone like Lampard and Gerrard dictate play. Players like Hazard, Di Maria, Ronaldo, Bale, Oscar are all players whose forte is creating and scoring goals, so statistics matter.

&gt; I hate when people use statistics for players who play in different midfield positions, because most of the time it usually means nothing.

Hazard and Di Maria play in effectively the same position so I don't know what you're even referring to.

You've just contradicted yourself there after claiming you hate to compare different midfield players. Modric and Di Maria are different players that play in different positions. Modric is comparable to Lampard, so that ties back into my first point. And Di Maria hasn't been playing CM, he's been playing CAM and used to play RW until middle of this season and Hazard has played in all LW, RW, CAM positions this season.

I know of teachers who wouldn't mark work properly. I had 1 or 2 bad teachers over my school life that I didn't like but never lazy.

It seems to be pretty rare stuff, but if you do find yourself caught in it, the usual rules apply - spread yourself out to maximise your surface area, then use every tool or piece of apparatus available to you to climb out.

Increasing a possibility of having an easier (or possible) conviction of a paedophile or rapist by exposing personal details of a person only suspected or in some situation only suspected due to the sole reason of one accusation is just very unfair.

&gt;I do not accept that road racing on bicycles is dangerous, so my answer would be nothing.

That's why road races have risk assessments, and if they don't meet a certain level of safety they do not go ahead.

true,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"&gt; I am disregarding kinetic energy because it makes little difference what energy the cycle has when it goes head first into a car with its own kinetic energy.

This is a rather silly dead cat argument.  You know perfectly well that I was referring to the danger to other road users.  Cars racing on the public road present a huge risk to other road users.  Bicycles doing the same present practically no risk to anyone but themselves.

That is why one is illegal and the other is not.

&gt; You can't ask drivers to plan for a sudden cycle race on faster roads who may be on their side of the road.

Which is why all road races in the UK urge participants to remain on their side of the road, and to respect all relevant laws.

&gt; Separate modes of transport, plan roads with safety and efficiency in mind, restrict things like road races on open roads. Even a rolling closures method would have been better, with outriders on motorcycles going ahead to block junctions to give cyclists the entire road.

I agree that segregation on the Dutch model would be hugely beneficial (but not that road races should be restricted).  But unless the outriders were police officers, they would have no power to close any roads or to order anyone to do anything.  And such measures would likely cost so much money that events would simply be cancelled.  And then you could say goodbye to Britain's Olympic cycling success.

Go check out what Afghanistan looked like before the Muslim extremists gained control.  Women walked around in pretty much the same clothing as they do in the west.  Don't tell me that those living in Taliban controlled areas suddenly discovered a previously unknown desire to cover themselves in plain, shapeless fabric with slits for eyes.

Added to which, no one is denying sexism here or anywhere else.  What some people *are* arguing is that the UK is not as bad as some other countries.

If, for example, pay grade B simply defined a range of jobs from £17K - £24K, but that each role had a structured pay scale, then I can't much see room for how they could claim discrimination, as it would just be a way of defining and collating that pay grade.

Though if part of that pay grade was the potential to move up the scale on a performance basis, just that no parameters would be considered for some of the positions within that role, ie. secretary and administration roles would be more closely monitored with guidelines on how to attain a higher payrate, but tradesmen were just told to suck it and accept what they had, then it would be unfair to class them under the same grade.

I don't think the problem here is what people think of particular lines of work, just that company streamlining has either not been implemented properly or not been implemeneted in a manner that clearly maps out which roles are entitled to what.

&gt;&gt;The highest rate was in Sweden, where, in 2011, the sexual assault rate was 181 for every 100,000 people.

Is Sweden really the most dangerous nation on Earth for sexual assault?  

Edit:  Doing a Google search, [I found this discussion](http://www.geocurrents.info/geography-of-crime-and-punishment/misleading-murder-and-rape-maps-and-the-the-sweden-rape-puzzle) 

&gt;If global murder-rate figures are problematic, rape-rate figures appear to be almost worthless. Consider, for example, the Index Mundi rape-rate map posted here, which indicates that Sweden and New Zealand have some of the highest levels of rape in the world, and that Egypt has one of the lowest. Although the map comes with a disclaimer,* it is hardly adequate. Could anyone possibly believe that Sweden has a higher rape rate than Egypt? Egypt is currently suffering a rape epidemic so severe that it is becoming a diplomatic issue. Sweden, meanwhile, consistently rates as one of the most gender egalitarian, nonviolent countries in the world.

Anybody else want to chime in?

Edit II:  From the same page -

&gt;As explained recently in the BBC: 

&gt;On the face of it, it would seem Sweden is a much more dangerous place than these other countries. But that is a misconception, according to Klara Selin, a sociologist at the National Council for Crime Prevention in Stockholm. She says you cannot compare countries’ records, because police procedures and legal definitions vary widely. In Sweden there has been this ambition explicitly to record every case of sexual violence separately, to make it visible in the statistics,” she says. “So, for instance, when a woman comes to the police and she says my husband or my fiance raped me almost every day during the last year, the police have to record each of these events, which might be more than 300 events. In many other countries it would just be one record – one victim, one type of crime, one record.”

true,L__McL,,Who would win us the Cup? Tim sure would.,"I'm, like all of us, a huge fan of Delph. I was very sceptical the first few years when he did nothing but now I'm glad we kept hold of him. Having him in the team is so important to us doing well. If we can keep the spine of Guzan-Vlaar-Delph-Benteke fit and on form we're a very good team.


Has Delph been our best player this season and why/why not?

For the first half of the season he was unequalled. Bit more aligned with the rest of teh team's performance this half but yes, our best player this season.

What position in particular is his best?

I'd say box-to-box CM. Someone who can affect both defence and attack. He's good enough in both aspects.

What formation and team does he play best in?

4-3-3 alongside Westwood and El Ahmadi for me. With 2 other CMs in there, he has more freedom to play how he wants to play

Do you think he will have interest from other clubs in the summer and how would you value him on current form?

I'd be surprised if someone wasn't interested. He may be more valuable to us than other clubs however so I wouldn't expect him to leave. I'd value him around £15mill.

Does he deserve an England call up after, or maybe even for the World Cup?

Yes. Not for the World Cup, it's too late for that. He's been as good as Barkley this season, just for a worse team.

I used to live on the corner of Rotton Park Rd and Gillott and it rarely took me 20 minutes to walk to Five Ways. It's not a particularly nice walk, but it only takes half an hour if you get lost :)

As another reply mentioned, if you can pick up a cheap bicycle, the University is only a couple of miles away. I walked from student accommodation around the University back to Rotton Park/Gillott in deep snow, at 2am in an hour. I'd expect it to take a lot less time in good weather on a bike!

The one problem I had with the area when I lived there, which is, admittedly, 20 years ago, is that it was riddled with prostitutes, who used the reservoir as their place of business. I assume that in the ensuing 20 years, they've been moved on, but I had head a few years ago that business was still booming around there.

Other than that, it's a nice area. The public transport isn't as bad as people are makign out, though. You have a circular bus route that runs at less than ten minute intervals that runs in a 25 mile route around the city outskirts, you have a minimum six buses running to the City Centre along the Hagley Road, which will take you to some nice destinations, going out of town. You have three train stations well within a half hour's walk, including the major national hub of New Street Station.

They've also had to put grovelling ads in newspapers because of the overall performance of their network. The other networks have had the occasional problem but O2 wins the award for overall unreliability by far.

Giffgaff adds another layer of unreliability, where they've had problems that O2 themselves haven't had - how often is it that they say ""sorry, goodybags may take hours to appear"" or that data stops working?

When it is working, you're stuck on GSM because invariably 3G isn't available where you are. It's fine if you're in an urban area (like Greater London).

&gt; switching saves me over 25 quid a month compared to my O2 contract, and is by far the best signal at home and work.

I'm saying there are cheap deals on networks that have joined the 21st century and don't have regular network failures, not that you have to sign up for a long and expensive contract - and I suspect the savings aren't as significant if you compared O2 SIM only to giffgaff, rather than contract with ""free"" phone vs GG

Last year everyone got very angry at the way that certain popular submissions, thought by moderators not to comply with the rules, were removed with absolutely no notice.

In the meta discussion in one of these instances, [I called for moderating log](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1eua4o/mods_why_did_you_remove_that_post_about_the_one/), viewable by all, where anyone could see what actions had been taken in /r/unitedkingdom. [The initial reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1eua4o/mods_why_did_you_remove_that_post_about_the_one/ca3xjir) by /u/Skuld rejected this as essentially being too onerous. /u/Kingy_who then [asked](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1eua4o/mods_why_did_you_remove_that_post_about_the_one/ca3xys3) if notice could be given where action was taken on popular threads. Mods /u/Skuld and /u/Ooer both [agreed to do this](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1eua4o/mods_why_did_you_remove_that_post_about_the_one/ca3y288).

**So my questions are as follows:**

1) Since this policy was stated, how many times have the mods posted a public explanation for the removal of a popular thread, excluding this post?

2) Do the mods feel that there is adequate communication between members and mods when moderating actions do occur?

3) Do the mods of /r/uk not feel that a more ideal solution would be to implement a moderating action log, [as has been done](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1eua4o/mods_why_did_you_remove_that_post_about_the_one/ca42wzr) by /r/anarchism?

This was from 2012 so possibly before you joined.

&gt; I've never had a data or goodybag delay? Or even heard of that? I'll assume it's true, but then O2 were often a few days late with the start of my new mins/data, so maybe an inherent network fault? Dunno.

It's a GG problem as their billing system is seperate to O2's. Stuff like http://community.giffgaff.com/t5/Service-Updates/RESOLVED-Slow-activations-and-Top-ups-18-01-2014/td-p/11498701

I don't know about the other places, but I'll be surprised if it's any good in Devon (outside of urban areas), because I live in Cornwall, travel around in Devon a fair bit and O2 (and Vodafone) are utter shite in both counties. EE/3 pisses all over them for 3G coverage.

&gt; and their signal is appalling. 

How long ago did you try 3? Does ""appalling"" mean ""in my house"" or outside? I travel around the south a lot (west and east) and honestly I don't have huge problems with the signal, the 3G coverage is infinitely better than O2 or Vodafone.

&gt; I guess 4G would be exciting if you lived in a city. I've only got an iPhone 4 though so not worth it obviously..

I don't live anywhere near 4G coverage, but I go to places that do often, so it's nice.
