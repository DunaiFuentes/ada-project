In the fourth picture I don't understand where you are seeing the defender's arm go over Costa when his right arm is clearly grabbing Costa in the armpit/chest section (note the shirt creases), and his left arm is on its way to doing the same, although that is debatable. Either way, the fact that his right arm his grabbing Costa is sufficient proof to understand what the defender was trying to do there.

&gt; On top of that the ref did a fairly good job and wasn't at fault for our loss.

Firstly, we didn't lose the match. Secondly, I never said he was at fault for the result. That point wasn't even up for discussion. But to suggest the ref had a good game is being dishonest. It took him 75 minutes to show Sunderland their first yellow, and it took an obvious horrendous tackle from behind for him do that. Rodwell and Johnson kept fouling us on the counter and they were never booked for it. He missed Costa's kick for which he should've been sent off. He booked Costa for an accidental contact because he knew he'd fucked up earlier + got pressured by the surrounding players and the crowd. No control over what the players were doing in the box from corners and on one instance actually called for a foul whilst Cahill was being grabbed and thrown to the ground by O'Shea.

1. This is a derby match.  On Boxing Day.

2. Your best option is through the ticket exchange.  You'll still need a membership to buy a ticket this way.  And each of your friends will need a membership to buy a ticket.

3. If tickets go on sale at 2am they will stop when they sell out, which should be pretty quick (see #1).

4. Next best option would be a scalper outside the Bridge on match day.  Hopefully it's not a fake ticket, and expect to pay a very pretty penny (see #1).

Of that money, only ¬£45m comes from matchday revenue - the rest comes from media and commercial deals. 

Matchday revenue is a string the club can pull if they want more money, but it's far from the most important one. Matchday revenue was less than a quarter of total revenue, and that was before the new BT Sport injection of money, Champions League income, and our new sponsorship deals that we got early this year. It's probably an even smaller proportion now. The club could screw a *lot* more money out of fans but in the grander scheme of things it wouldn't affect the bottom line all that much. 

I think you're partly right, but I don't think it's the greed of the supporters. It's more the supply and demand of tickets for the club. There are people paying money to be on the scheme to get tickets to games, and they *still* can't get tickets, because demand is just ridiculously high. And that's despite the ridiculous ticket prices right now.

Yes, the fans want the club to be successful, but even if they didn't give a shit about success, the club is still a business. Even if they completely ignore the fans, the club is *always* going to want more money. It has investors to answer to, revenues to maximise, returns to deliver. It has a reputation and a brand to build, and the easiest way to do that is to win trophies. It has a need to make money above disgruntled fans complaining about lack of success.

The fact is, that at the current prices Liverpool FC have a product that reliably and almost instantly sells out - something very few companies in the world can claim to have. They could probably charge a good bit more and they'd still fill the ground, if anything it's a credit to them that they haven't. There aren't many businesses in the world that are happy to cut their product price below the sweet-spot of supply and demand. 

I don't think it's greed of anyone. It's just a pressure on the club to charge more for tickets when they're still selling out comfortably every game, combined with the fact that they're not completely hammering ticket prices because in actuality charging 20% more for tickets would barely increase their overall revenues in exchange for pissing off a huge amount of the fanbase even more than they already are.

I bought a two up, two down terrace house in Nottingham for ¬£22,000. It was my 4th or 5th attempt to buy something. I was gazumped on all the others. Luckily I hit sellers that had some principles. Within weeks of moving in, I was offered ¬£35,000 for it. No real point in taking it because I wouldn't have been able to buy anywhere else.

Fast forward to 1993. I was made redundant and the bottom had fallen out of the property market. I had to wait a long time to get an offer of ¬£17,500 on the house. I took it because I had to move to Cambridge for work and couldn't afford a mortgage and rent at the time. I had it easy compared to some folks. Friends of mine had bought a house for ¬£115,000 in Reading. They ended up having it repossessed and auctioned for around  ¬£50,000.

false,Locke66,null,null,"&gt; I don't understand how someone can be a 2nd, 3rd or 4th-generation immigrant.

I think it really comes down to how they retain their cultural values.  In theory the vast majority of immigrants will identify more and more as a British person with values that are compatible with the dominant culture the longer they live here and this will be accelerated the further removed they are from their culture of origin (1st gen a little, 2nd gen a bit more, 3rd gen a lot more and so on).  If it actually worked like this consistently then I think there would be a lot less concern and titles like ""3rd generation immigrant"" would be almost irrelevant as in your case. 

Imo the issues start when migrants refuse to identify as British and/or continue to maintain their culture of origin as a dominant way of life across multiple generations via ""ghettoisation"" (Examples: racially specific community centers, religious schools etc).   This seems to be particularly true of migrants that come from cultures that are very different from our own or have very strong conservative values.  This is probably the biggest problem in the UK with immigration imo as we have a reasonable number of cities that have huge communities of specific cultural groups that are not integrating well.

As a side note I do think there are many cases where it's good to retain a migrants culture as it adds to our own or it's benign enough to be compatible with our own but then when it comes to things like suppression of women, racial and/or homophobic discrimination and harmful religious zealotry (particularly observing religious law above the law of the land) there is a problem.",0,1417395555,null,0,1417404790,0,cmhgewp,t3_2nvrj2,t1_cmhgewp,t1_cmhf7jt,null,1425747844,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

When you say you can see immigrants, I take that as an implication that you assume all non-whites to be immigrants, which I would object to because I think it's unfair to the many British citizens who are not white.

So yeah, the problem is what you said. And wording is a part of that, but the way you present yourself and your ideas is not everybody else's responsibility, it's on you.

He had to learn how to cope with physical football in England. That means he had to remake his style and bulk up to hold onto possession. The fact that he spent half of last year injured has apparently totally flown over your head. When you're out injured you're not improving anything.

false,StinkyKlinky,null,null,"Very frustrating match. I think it will provide a lot of points for us to learn from.

1. We don't have enough wingers and forcing Barkley on the wing is a bad idea. All it does is clog up the most important zone for us. We can't have another match with Lukaku, E'too and Barkley starting together. Barkley out wide just drifts right to the middle where he is comfortable and E'too drops deep to receive the ball so they are right next to each other. How many times was Coleman open in space because Eriksen did not track back but he had no one to play combinations with? The only way I can see playing Barkley and Etoo together is if you do a 4-3-3 and have Barkley deeper flanked by two of Barry, Besic and McCarthy.

2. When Stones comes back to full fitness he steps right in. While Distin recently has been much better compared to his disastrous first month, he still can't distribute and him and Jags are not a shut down tandem as in past years.

3. Howard did not have a good match and was at fault on the first goal. However he is what he is. A second tier EPL goalie. Right now the best goalies in the league are (in order) Courtois, DeGea and Lloris. Then there is a steep drop off and Howard is in the same category as Begovic. He is inconsistent and prone to some very head scratching mistakes but he organizes the defense well and in general is a very good shot stopper. The question isn't whether would it be better if we had an upgrade at keeper (obviously), the question is who do you get to replace him? The only options within the league who I think would step in as an improvement would be Begovic and Cech (wages). However, is that the best place to spend our limited transfer budget. Moan all we want, Howard is here until the summer at least.

Ratings:

Howard- 4.5  Didn't have much to do and one big mistake.

Baines- 6.5 Didn't do too much wrong but didn't make a major impact

Distin - 5.0 Looked lost on defense, couldn't corral Harry Kane and distribution out of the back was his standard ""not great""

Jagielka - 6.5 As a defender I thought he played well but as the leader of the defense there was too much sloppiness that needed to be fixed which was not. 

Coleman - 7.0 No attacks really came down his side (as Eriksen was mostly threatening when he switched sides or went to the middle). Needs an actual winger to be effective. I would like to see a return to last year of pienaar with Baines and Mirallas ahead of coleman

Mirralas - 7.0 Fantastic goal and a constant threat. Wish he stayed on longer but after just coming back from a long layoff, playing 80 minutes Thursday and a match on Wednesday I see the reasoning. 

Barry - 4.5 One of the worst matches of the season for him. Chalk it up to him not being in full fitness but he was slow on the ball and didn't have as many vital intercepts as usual. His give away on the second goal has no excuses.

Besic -  7.0 Almost another terrible mistake, but he was our most active defender and showed some very quick feet.  Also some of the balls he played out wide were fantastic. We need to switch fields faster against an organized and compact defense

Barkley- 7.0 (in the middle) / 4.5 (as a winger) We need to stop playing him out of position. It just does not work. He looked better taking on defenders and running with the ball compared to the past few matches but still had some sloppy turnovers.

E'too - 4.0 Did not space himself well with Barkley and missed a lot of chances to feed through balls to Coleman. Didn't do much of anything

Lukaku - 6.0 Didn't do much, but to be fair he had no service. 

Osman - N/A
McGeady - N/A

There is no legally defined process for this, and it varies between the parties. This is in contrast to the US system of ""primary elections"", which are part of the normal political process. The way that the parties choose candidates may vary with time. For instance  the national Labour party has restricted the choice of the local party in the past, forcing all-women candidate lists.

You then elect an MP from those who are standing. That usually gives a majority of one party in the Commons. The Queen will then summon someone to the palace to command him to form a government, i.e become prime minister. Normally this is the leader of the party with an absolute majority, but constitutionally it is the Queen's choice. She has to pick someone who can ""form a government"", i.e. command a majority of the votes in the Commons - her role is to unstick the democratic process, not over-ride it. Very, very occasionally, the fact that the monarch has a choice actually matters. This happened last in the 1960's when Eden resigned and the Conservatives had no way to select a new leader for their parliamentary party. After consulting several important statesmen, she called Harold MacMillan to the palace.

Ok, after a PM is selected, the PM will pick a Cabinet. At this point, you finally have a government. BTW, I don't think that there is any requirement for a member of the cabinet to be elected.

The thing Lamela needs more than anything else is space.  Too often we've played a system this year that has denied him that, with too many players crowding the same area and closing down room to operate.  He needs to get better with his choices in those situations, but at least he generally tries something, which is more than can be said of most of our team's stagnant attacking play over the last 18 months.

The Southern parts of Lewisham Borough and and Greenwich Borough and some parts of Bexley Borough are still mostly white but have a lot of people moving in from more central areas of London.

Where I live (Welling) there's now noticeably more Indian and Black Caribbean people who used to live in places like Lewisham, Woolwich and Deptford. 

They are replacing white people who've moved to quieter areas out in Bromley Borough, Eastern Bexley Borough or Kent. It must be said though, that a lot of the 'white flighters' aren't purely doing it because brown people have started living on their street. They've simply decided that having a cheaper, more economical home in a quieter neighbourhood is worth the increase in money and time spent on commuting.

I also *almost* gave Kane a 10, but even though he created both goals and several other chances, he did ""pull a Lamela"" (ie, dribbling unnecessarily into a crowd of defenders and losing the ball) a few times as well.

I really hope we see the Soldado-Kane pairing again v. Chelsea.  Our attack has looked its best this season when they've been on the pitch together.  I just hope Kane isn't too tired, as he played the whole game, pressed hard for most of it (see also: Bobby's goal!), and looked pretty gassed by the end there.

I sound a little more  ""Manc"" than I do ""Lancs"" and when you reach somewhere like Warrington you get a mix of ""Scouse"" (Liverpool) and ""Manc"".  So our accent is very fluid over very short distances.

Now also it's worth pointing out that it is possible to tell what part of Manchester or Liverpool someone is from based on their accent.  The same goes for Birmingham.  

Birmngham and Wolverhampton are so close that they might as well be one city and yet there is a slightly different accent between the two but they are part of what is known as the Black Country accent which is the regional catch-all.  These are all harder to find good videos for unfortunately. 

You should also note that Birmingham is no more than 2 hours drive from London and about the same distance from Manchester. The UK is really that small (it's about the same size as Florida)

false,xu85,null,null,"I think it's to do with relationships. Men in stable, long term relationships have more impetus to succeed in life because other people like kids/wife are genuinely dependent on them. If you look at some Islamic countries, they have tremendous social problems because of the lack of relationships. When large groups of men have no wives they see no reason to continue their existence and that is very, very dangerous. In the UK we can get away with it for a period of time because we have mindless distractions and ""side quests"" like television, video games, drugs, internet, alcohol, reddit karma. But the consumption of these things are all symptoms of something deeper. One of the great things about religion is that its highly conducive to producing stable societies, and thus if you look at graphs the population skyrocketed around 2000 years ago.

Now women are either dependent on a man or dependent on the state. Since voting became universal, the female vote has resulted in a big increase in the welfare state. Women don't ""need' men as much as they did, because the government can provide for them and replace the role of the father. Then since the 1960s more and more women have been getting in to higher education. Which is a pretty good thing. The problem is that women always marry up, so once a woman is educated to a high degree, and/or earns a good amount of money, she will always expect her husband to earn more. The biological male ""provider"" isn't going to be bred out in 3 generations. The net effect is more women chasing less high quality men, widening the gap. Now there are plenty of women in their late 20s and 30s happy to be single because they are earning their own money and genuinely don't need male support, plus there is less societal pressure to settle down. (There's also the problem of media creating an unrealistic expectation in what to expect in a partner, and I include widespread porn in this) This can only keep most going until their mid 30s when their biology reminds them that they've forgotten to do something, so they look for a man, but resent the fact that they can't obtain the same quality of man they could in their early 20s.

I believe that if we weren't comparing him so often with Adebayor, it might be a different conversation because, when Adebayor is not in top form, he often looks disinterested, and has been linked at least twice with fomenting dissent within the dressing room. I have been incredibly disappointed by Soldado's play since coming to Spurs by in large, but have been incredibly impressed by the way that he carries himself and conducts himself. 

Additionally, even while not on form, you hear Soldado's name mentioned in the buildup to what becomes a goal before the last name called (the person scoring, oviously).  As far as I can remember, the only time you hear Adebayor's name in a commentary is as the last name called, as he is always either the last player in the chain that leads to the goal, or completely removed from the play.

I think you're getting an overly harsh reaction to calling out what, at times, has been a Soldado circlejerk on this sub.  However, I think that your original comment of getting him out of the team is unfounded because a) there was no interest in an out of form striker and you cannot sell to someone who is not buying.  b) what interest we could drum up would likely have been at such cut prices that it would have cemented the decision as horrid, when at the moment there is certainly the capability of his redemption, and c) he has always been a positive part of the dressing room, so far as I am aware which, while not worth his price tag, is something that you always want to cultivate when it's available to you.",0,1417404179,null,0,false,0,cmhknmp,t3_2nv3tl,t1_cmhknmp,t1_cmh7wek,null,1425745865,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

Ideally, we're playing him as a 60-70th minute sub while we're already leading, and also he's come on for someone up front so it's a midfield three of him and Barry and McCarthy.

- City has many young fans. MANY. What we do lack is huge numbers in the 20-30ish generation (which I am in) because of how bad we were when those were growing up (kids tend to follow success), meaning United picked up many kids in that age group. But now, you see kids and teenagers all around Manchester in City shirts and the entire North Stand (which we attack in the 2nd half of games) is called the Family Stand for parents with kids. Our fan base tends to be young and middle aged or old, not so many in between which is probably affecting the atmosphere now as young adults tend to be the loudest. In 10 years, City will have a huge number of young adult fans. Right now, there is a group called the 1894 Group with quite a lot in this age range (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAFeyqg213g&amp;sns=tw).

- The empty stadium thing is absolute nonsense and a myth. We do have empty seats but I can assure you most of these are sold and it happens at every other ground in the league. Season ticket holders don't turn up for a variety of reasons. Seats on level 1, those which are on TV, are almost exclusively season ticket holders so bought and paid for. And despite being visible on TV, the majority of the stadium is full for most games. City's situation is not unique, it's the same as anywhere (attendances are lower for cup games except FA Cup) and all bar two league games in the past few years have sold every ticket available.

But because our rivals are United and United have the most fans and therefore the most online presence, a great number of myths and mistruths about our attendances have emerged. The reality is, City have had average attendances of 40,000+ since moving this stadium about a decade ago. In the 2003/04 stadium, our first after moving from Maine Road, City averaged 46,834, the third highest in the league. Last season, the average was 46,974, the 4th highest in the league. This season they are in the 45,000s because of reduced capacity due to the expansion.

City's attendances are in the top 15 on the European continent. So as you can see, there is a loyal and consistent fan base that has been there since long before the Arab money (unfortunately, for simple-minded folk having a rich owner turns 'long suffering loyal fans' into 'glory fans').

Even before the takeover, City had amazing attendances, usually higher than Chelsea and Liverpool. Right now, City have the 4th highest in the league behind United, Arsenal and Newcastle. Next year we will overtake Newcastle with the stadium expansion.

There is nothing really wrong with our fan base, it's just that when the said bollocks is repeated ad nauseum on Twitter and other social network, it becomes a viral myth.

The team is good, the club is good and fan friendly (but prices becoming less fan friendly, in line with all top clubs and the English football culture of greed), and our fan base is good and probably the least hostile of any top club (except when we play United).

But really you shouldn't need convincing to keep supporting a club... that isn't really what it's all about. YOU either like the club or don't, irrespective of what people say.

Chronic depersonalization refers to depersonalization disorder, which is classified by the DSM-IV as a dissociative disorder.

They say you don't pick your club; your club picks you. That's what happened with me. I didn't want to bandwagon on a big club, so United, Liverpool, Arsenal, and Chelsea were out of the question. You know how many bandwagon NFL fans there are in Charlotte that pull for teams other than the Panthers. I always hated those people and didn't want to be their soccer-fan counterpart.

United were constantly billed as the biggest club in the world, but then I found out they had cross-town rivals, a club called Manchester City. A club that had a traditionally working-class fanbase, rabid and irreverent fans that would sing and cheer win or lose, and had experienced plenty of ups and downs rather than constant success that made them the ""default"" club of millions of plastic fans, glory hunters, and other assorted assclowns worldwide.

The recent dips in attendance during the Champions League are due to a lot of factors, but disloyalty is not one of them. City fans are some of the most loyal fans you'll find. City are in no danger of relegation anymore, but still have that ""Typical City"" aura where they produce inexplicable results more often than you'd care to see.

As a long-suffering Panthers fan, I really appreciate a club like City, which is one-of-a-kind for lots of reasons, and that I've stuck with through thick, thin, thinner, and much thinner.

Being a City fan means always expecting the unexpected and a constant attitude of insurrection against the bigger clubs. Even though we ourselves are a big club now, we still have lots of quirkiness and suffer from occasional ""Cityitis.""

How does that promote more offense and goals? If anything it hinders it because the attackers aren't able to do the things they'd be able to do if the rules weer followed. Also I don't know what you mean by a decade ago that would've been great defending. Shirt pulling has never been called great defending.

&gt;It doesn't show the amount of force or impediment made on Costa nor does it even show intent to stop him - maybe it was an errant arm? 

So a shirt clearly being pulled doesn't show intent to stop him? Both arms around him doesn't show intent to stop him? Right. Rules are you're not allowed to lay your hands on another opponent because it impedes his movement. In other words, you're allowed to push (to a certain extent), but never pull. In both those pictures, there are clear signs of Costa being pulled.

&gt;I think xenophobia is quite a strong word. Phobias are irrational. There's nothing irrational about valuing a community with long local roots.

That depends on how you've rationalised it. If your logic is faulty, then it may be irrational. You haven't listed any benefits so people might jump to conclusions on what those benefits are.

&gt;Most people in big cities have never experienced that because (a) that's where most immigration occurs but also (b) cities result from urbanisation anyway which also leads to rootless communities.

I think a lot of people in big cities would argue about being called rootless. You should define ""rootless communities"", otherwise it sounds like you're saying no one should move anywhere ever. 

&gt;There are benefits to communities with immigration, there are benefits to communities with almost no immigration. I don't think we need to name-call those who prefer the latter.

Well, that really depends on why you prefer the latter, if it's because you want everyone to look and sound like you, then there are some scientific terms that fit. 

&gt;EDIT This must be being downvoted by people who have never lived in a tight community like I have described. It's a shame with all their cosmopolitan experience they are unable to understand that it's possible for different people to value different things.

You haven't described a community really, just roots and no immigration, there's a lot more that goes into a community than those two things. 

&gt;Here's the thing: you may want to eradicate people who are anti-immigration. 

If you're addressing the down voters here I think it's hardly fair to equate taking away internet points with eradication. It sounds like you're addressing the wider opinion you've received in response to your beliefs from people who don't share them with you. 

&gt;You will only manage that if you understand them first. Know your enemy! If you think they are all irrational foreigner haters you are in for a shock--and you won't get very far.

The things is, we (science) already know a great deal about prejudice, racism and xenophobia. Google scholar returns ""About 938,000"" articles when searching for prejudice. Two things to take away: everyone's a little bit racist, there are ways to mitigate that. Look into Contact Hypothesis if you want to find out how.

Dier - Fazio - Vertonghen - Davies

Mason - Bentaleb

Lennon - Eriksen - Lamela

Kane/Soldado

Trying to downplay their main offensive threats - Hazard and Fabregas - while still being competent on the attack.

- I'm sure Naughton would also be good at RB, but Dier on his day is what we need to try and minimize Hazard's impact. He's seemed better defensively, and stays back more often. He really will have to be on his day though, no second half Newcastle performances.

- The defensive midfield just has to be good; Chelsea doesn't have a big physical presence in attack without Costa. Bentaleb and Mason played really well today so I think they deserve it, but Capoue could come on if he's fit to add some defensive solidity.

- Lennon, as people have been saying, also fits the bothersome attacker role, but from a defensive wing position. He can help with Hazard or Willian or whoever happens to be playing on his side. And additionally, if we're going to have our backs against the wall, we can use his speed to threaten on the counter. Plays up all his strengths.

- Lamela I think could be key - his tendency to drift into the middle would bring him into Fabregas' space. This would be good going both ways - he's got a great pressing work rate, so he could be the Oscar-type attacking mid who nibbles at the heels of their key playmaker. Plus, in the counterattack he'll be in the perfect place to take advantage of Fabregas' relative lack of positional discipline. Fabregas sometimes tends to leave space behind him while trying to push forward, and if Lamela can get into that space he'll have a chance to make something happen.",0,1417416024,null,0,false,0,cmhpmum,t3_2nvhzl,t1_cmhpmum,t3_2nvhzl,null,1425743472,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

false,anaximander19,null,null,"Well, I put my profile on LinkedIn and various other places a month or two before I finished the course, got my CV updated, that sort of thing, just to be ready when I had to start looking for jobs. I was contacted by a company who saw my profile on a careers site, they hired me before I sat finals. I went in one day a week in between exams and revision, and started work full time the week after. Six months later I'm loving it.

I was lucky though. Lucky they happened to be actively hiring, lucky my placement year was spent doing what they were after, lucky I work in a rapidly expanding industry. Still, there's things I can recommend that help your chances:

* take a placement if you can; you learn loads, it boosts your final-year performance, and gets past the ""must have experience"" issue. Plus it lets you see what a job is like before committing to a career. The pay doesn't hurt either.

* do extracurricular stuff. Stuff relating to your career makes you look motivated and improves your skills; unrelated stuff makes you look like an actual interesting person who might be nice to work with, and improves teamwork and all that.

* get your CV looked at by the placements office or the employability team. They know how to make it look professional.

* look at job ads before you finish the course. It gives you time to talk to course staff about what the jobs are like, and to pay particular attention to areas of the course that may come up as interview questions. It also lets you start applying before graduation, to beat the sudden flood that companies tend to get. Nothing reduces final-exam stress like the knowledge you have a job already.

http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/rape_and_sexual_offences/consent/#a03

&gt; In R v Bree [2007] EWCA 256, the Court of Appeal explored the issue of capacity and consent, stating that, if, through drink, or for any other reason, a complainant had temporarily lost her capacity to choose whether to have sexual intercourse, she was not consenting, and subject to the defendant's state of mind, if intercourse took place, that would be rape. However, where a complainant had voluntarily consumed substantial quantities of alcohol, but nevertheless remained capable of choosing whether to have intercourse, and agreed to do so, that would not be rape. Further, they identified that capacity to consent may evaporate well before a complainant becomes unconscious. Whether this is so or not, however, depends on the facts of the case.

The accused also has the possible defence that there was a reasonable belief of consent:

&gt; The Act abolished the Morgan defence of a genuine though unreasonably mistaken belief as to the consent of the complainant. The defendant (A) has the responsibility to ensure that (B) consents to the sexual activity at the time in question. It will be important for the police to ask the offender in interview what steps (s)he took to satisfy him or herself that the complainant consented in order to show his or her state of mind at the time.

&gt; The test of reasonable belief is a subjective test with an objective element. The best way of dealing with this issue is to ask two questions:

&gt;1. Did the defendant believe the complainant consented? This relates to his or her personal capacity to evaluate consent (the subjective element of the test).  
2. If so, did the defendant reasonably believe it? It will be for the jury to decide if his or her belief was reasonable (the objective element).

In their proposals for new powers not even the snp asked for this. What you describe would mean Scotland can choose it's own currency, not necessary since its impractical to have a part of one country using a different currency to the rest. Scotland would have absolute control over its own laws on matters like drug policy and terrorism, which are heavily linked to defence and foreign policy and could not be devolved. It would mean Scotland has complete power over the monarchy in Scotland, which would at least be difficult to implement given the monarchy is one thing for the whole country and defining it as a separate thing for Scotland wouldn't be straightforward or practical. Complete devolution of broadcasting (which the snp do want) would mean the bbc and channel four (the two state owned broadcasting companies) are not broadcast at all in Scotland and replaced with Scottish alternatives. Not impossible to implement but if Scotland is going to remain in the UK there will surely be a need for some level of UK wide broadcasting, and maybe there are people in Scotland who actually want to watch those channels.

Your definition of Devo Max is highly unrealistic and goes beyond even the powers that the crown dependencies have. Still, what has been offered is some way off what could be provided so understandably you are upset by this. But your pessimism, though understandable, is not helpful. The party leaders are nothing more than three mortals like you and everyone else. This country does not belong to them and to do something as significant as leaving it based on the actions of three people is extreme compared to the alternative of standing your ground and successfully challenging them. Remember, Scotland is not alone on this. Politicians in Wales and Northern Ireland are also after more powers, and regions of England are speaking up too. Work with them. In a straight Scotland vs Westminster dispute, Westminster is in the more powerful position, but greater numbers can still successfully challenge it. To use browns own words, he said ""in a year or two"". Be calm and patient, it has only been three months and this is the first recommendation, there is still room to challenge them. This isn't going to happen quickly and devolution may be a gradual thing. There is the problem that giving Scotland extensive powers like corporation tax now might allow it to challenge other parts of the country that have no means of competing.

I think it is worth remembering that independence is not automatically going to create a better Scotland, and the first few years are likely to be very challenging and difficult. It will only succeed if the people and politicians are prepared to put in the long term work and effort to make the plan succeed, even if they might lose out in the short term.

Whilst warning other people about jumping to conclusions you're jumping to conclusions about people thinking you're jumping to conclusions. 

I think (not concluding, just throwing out an idea) you're saying that anti-immigration sentiments are not as prompted by xenophobia or irrational thought as people think. So I'd like to know what rational, sane, non-xenophobic arguments are there against immigration?

Attainment at my old comprehensive school is fairly low across the board, and that isn't because the people who attend are any less intelligent on average than children from elsewhere in the UK - it's because there's a fairly wide perception of school as being unnecessary because there aren't any jobs around and obviously you're not going to go to university, that's too expensive and it's for smart people, and you're neither of those things.

In school I can only remember a couple of teachers ever mentioning university as an option for students, and even then it was only to me and a couple of the girls (I'm the only boy from my year to go to university and to do A-levels, although some years on from that that is starting to change). 

There are people I went to school with who left being unable to read and write. That's not because they're stupid, it's because when they were at school they didn't care, their parents didn't care, and eventually the teachers had to stop trying because they had other students to manage. I think the problem is a very complex problem with a bunch of different inputs, but I think a key issue is education - of both parents and children. I have friends who failed to get a C in English or maths, which has effectively meant a whole slew of low-skill jobs aren't available to them.

This is really irrelevant. The whole City Football Group thing should be avoided at all costs in this discussion. It really does make it look like we've set them up for no other purpose than to circumvent UEFA - which isn't true- and its going to turn a lot of people away from NYCFC. Don't get me wrong, I'm a City fan not a NYFC fan, but if they do shit without one of their 2 named players and lose support because they are just seen as a puppet club, it's not great for us either.

Consider it the same as any other team with a loanee at another club. It's going to be a 3-way agreement between the clubs and Lampard. I hope he stays, but I'm expecting him to go - and to be honest as much as I enjoy watching him play, it also makes me annoyed that a 35 y/o 6 month loanee is so integral to the squad at the moment. We shouldn't be relying on loaned players! 

I also think his influence has only been so obvious because of Silva's injury - he's usually the person he controls the flow of the game, keeps things moving, makes those simple passes. Lampard has essentially taken over that role.

Having said that though I think he's been a great signing, he's still a fantastic player, and I hope he plays in Rome. Also I can't believe how much better he's adapted to getting old than Gerrard. Hopefully he stays but without causing a big stir about City football group.

Personally, I believe Britain would not have so many problems with terrorists and radicals had Blair not run off to join Bush in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The fact that we've had terrorist attacks in our country is down to Blair's shitty foreign policy.

If the Northern Ireland Assembly should collapse, then we would be run directly from Westminster. This would mean two things in the short term;


Theresa Villiers as secretary of State for Northern Ireland would be in overall charge of government in Northern Ireland. Other members of the government, either Conservative or Liberal Democrat would be appointed to the ministries of state for NI (Health, Justice etc.).


In the past, laws in NI under direct rule were made via Orders in Council, statutory instruments which are not subjected to the fullness of scrutiny that legislation passed by Stormont are subject to. They are passed by the Privy Council, not the whole house and are considered secondary legislation.


In terms of scrutiny, we would have Question time for the secretary of state and the NI select committee. Aside from the obvious issues of timing, we would also suffer in terms of Sinn Fein not being able to (or willing to) participate. In addition, we would have to share time in these debates/committee meetings with non-NI MPs.
Academic research on the legacy of direct rule is pretty damning on it. Rick Wilford wrote a fair amount about it, and he characterised it as having a permanent feeling of temporariness. 


And although I promised I would avoid speculation, I will say that a lot of the people who think that ‚Äúthe assembly are all jokers‚Äù and we should ‚Äúkick ‚Äòem out‚Äù might not realise how little say we will have in our own future if the assembly does collapse. David Cameron and Edna Kenny seem to be considerably less concerned with NI than Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern were.

I can't trust what you say, I can't believe a man like you can lead a party, let alone a country.


You might not like it, but the Tories have rebalanced the public vs private sector workforce, the cuts the Tories did to the deadhead excessive workforce of the public sector have seen jobs being created in the private sector instead.  

Unemployment is down, Investment in the UK is up, the UK economy is growing faster than expected and more than most EU countries which are entering recession again.  And the Business community far prefer the Tory policy rather than return to excessive public spending of the labour party.



But Ed, you spin the figures however you want, but the debt is rising, that's a problem, it looks like it's getting better with positive signs from the business community that pay will see a increase next year.  But the net borrowing is falling from when they came to power, a surplus is still expected within the next 5 years.

Regulated by paramilitaries no matter what we do! Jokes aside, I'm not sure selling regulated, higher priced cannabis will do much damage to the sale of cannabis by gangs and paramilitaries when they can sell it at a lower price. Are the police going to be chasing down unlawful sellers?

If people were to be ""patient"" then there would be no future devolution. Politicians in Westminster do not want to give away any more powers than they need to. The only way more reform will happen is if people keep up that pressure. 

The only stable and lasting constitutional settlements are either a federal UK or an independent Scotland. The current Westminster system doesn't work for Scotland and it doesn't work for English people either, the problem is there is no widespread public interest in England to change it. There is no interest in England for regional assemblies. The north east was offered devolution in 2004 and they rejected it. Transport spending in London is ¬£2,700 per person, in the North-East it's ¬£5 per person. That's a pretty shit deal if you ask me, the best way to solve that problem is to have each region decide how much they want to spend on transport, but no one in England is asking for that. While some people might agree in principle with creating a federal Britain, no one's actually doing anything about it! There are no widely supported campaign groups calling for English devolution, there are no public meetings taking place in England calling for English devolution, no ones talking about English devolution in the pub. It's just not a major issue. If the constitutional arrangement is a major issue for 5 million people but another 50 million people don't really care, then why would the 500 English MPs give away more powers by creating a federal UK? A federal UK will only exist when the English public demand it. If 45% of Scotland saying ""Enough's enough"" isn't going to get that to happen, then nothing will.

The major issue in the 2015 General Election will be reducing immigration. I don't personally think that is a major issue for people in Scotland, if anything Scotland needs more immigration. But when you are in a union with a country 10 times larger, what the larger country feels is important is obviously going to dominate. That's why the current union is untenable and why the constitution is going to be the biggest issue in Scotland for the foreseeable future. 

You said ""there is no reason you can't work with people all over Britain to push for reform"" and the reason is that although people in the North of England and elsewhere are not happy with the Westminster system, they are doing absolutely nothing about it as far as I can see. In Scotland people are doing something about it. If there was a movement throughout the UK for federalism then the movement for Scottish independence would die, England make up 90% of the country, the English public have to lead that movement.

Except they won't get in, and my vote helps them on that path to maturity of a proper party.  It happened with Labour, Tory, Lib Dem and so on.  Once a party gets to a certain size and popularity the extremist views are watered down and sensible policies replace some of the more dubious ones.

Would Ed be worse?  No, of course not.  He's no more a leader than Mickey mouse of Disneyland.  His advisors and special assistants would tell him what to do, and he would do what he's told by others.

That's my main point,  everything that Ed sprouts seems like it comes out of a advisors notebook, I know it happens to every leader, but they don't look so goddam pathetic saying it.  Ed isn't a leader, he looks like a nice chap, but he just isn't charismatic and authoritative.  Sorry if it sounds like I'm insulting your guy, but I cannot connect with him. 


Essentially I'm saying Ed pretends to be ""of the people"" when in reality he is a privately schooled, well educated person who went straight out of University to work in a MP's office without touching a proper job.  And he pretends to know what ""The Working Class Want"",  doesn't fly with me.  Give me Prescott or Brown or Johnstone, anyone else but Ed and I'd vote for them again,  but under Ed Miliband?

A lot of those jobs are un-flashy but and won't draw much attention but if you know what you are looking for then you can assess their performance.

But the point is that Osborne said it would be, that was what justified the 'harsh' cuts now, that we'd have already removed the deficit and we'd be running a budget surplus now (taxing more than we need) to reduce the public sector debt.

All parties were on board with the idea that the debt was too high, they just had varied policies:

- labour's idea was broadly to 'hold steady' and continue with planned spending and investment (but not more) and wait for the global economy to recover and eventually 'inflate away' the debt
- lib dem's idea was broadly to cut spending in some areas (trident and home office) but also with some increases for the sake of fairness (bank levy, a form of land value tax, pupil premium, pension increase, personal allowance increase, abolish student loans) and reduce the state's liabilities
- the conservative idea was to cut hard and fast across all areas, increase VAT, reduce the size of the state and generally 'open the doors' to MNCs and HNWIs and let those capital inflows fuel the recovery

We have done most of the Tory policies, and some of the lib-dem ones, but despite the focus on 'cutting hard and fast' we didn't really get the bounce-back we needed to pay for it. It's a swing and a miss for Osborne, but because of the recovery of the global economy he will likely be heralded as the savior of the UK come election time anyway.

I think this is the only government that has completely missed all of their own targets and yet people still think they're doing a great job. I mean, maybe I'm wrong and I'd love that to be demonstrated clearly.

With regards to cycling: I'm absolutely happy to see a cycling infrastructure continue to be developed, I've said this countless times. However it directly benefits cyclists just as a gym directly benefits the members of that gym. 

A gym also helps people with their health and results in less strain on the NHS. Do we subsidise gyms? Green energy provides benefits to air quality and we don't do nearly enough to promote *them*... 

And regardless - as I said - we will still need motorways. Funding is not infinite.

I personally would not mind being taxed on my cycling equipment if it helped to fund a ring-fenced cycling infrastructure that I could then go on to use. It would *still* be cheaper than a tank of petrol and everyone wins, with more money to build better infrastructures. 

As a cyclist, others complaining about that feels like they want to have their cake and eat it ‚Äì for free.

That depends entirely on the town or city. Cambridge and London are basically flat, by virtue of the fact that much of the South of England is an alluvial plain. Cycling in Matlock or Bath is a very different matter!

I know people who cycle 10 miles to work each day in Surrey. They can get up past 25mph and get to work in under half an hour. That's great, but if I tried it locally I'd take hours, because for 5 of the 10 miles I'd be pushing the bike up 20% grade hills.

Space saving - cars vs cycle speaks for itself.

Cash savings - nhs, road wear, pollution, deaths, less congestion, less sick days etc. All things that benefit everyone.

false,fuchsiamatter,null,null,"&gt; Studies do show that fathers working more hours is correlated with childhood obesity.

I‚Äôd be very interested in seeing those. My cursory look at Google only gave up results that, somewhat ironically, reverted to working *mothers* and childhood obesity. 

In any case, ‚Äúworking more hours‚Äù is not the same thing at all‚Ä¶ I think we can all agree that working too much is a generally bad idea not only for the worker‚Äôs children, but for the worker him/herself. That‚Äôs why workers‚Äô rights are so important. And, like I said in my previous comment, I am open to the idea that there might be a correlation between parents who work too much and not only childhood obesity, but overall bad parenting outcomes ‚Äì in fact, I would posit that insufficient guarantees of work/life balance for workers in the US might go a long way to explaining the connection found in the American studies: maybe both parents have more time to focus on their family lives in Europe. 

But my point was that nobody would ever think to ask whether fathers working *at all* might be bad for their children‚Ä¶

&gt; Sorry if I was a dick, that was not my intention. I just felt like you came out of the gates roaring at a strawman that, while in your mind was connected to a lot of other conceptual baggage, was to me a simple proposal that is either factual or not. It appears it isn't really, which is wonderful.

Ok, so I will totally cop to having thought this out a lot more than anybody else on this thread (although I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd describe thinking as ‚Äúbaggage‚Äù, but ok). The thing is the automatic reflex of blaming everything that is wrong with the modern family on working mothers is laden with so many logical fallacies it becomes difficult to disprove it without unpacking them one by one ‚Äì there is just *so much wrong* with it, I honestly don‚Äôt see how it isn‚Äôt obvious that any objective study will not find a causative relationship. In other words, sometimes ‚Äúideology‚Äù is simply logical thinking. 

And, with respect, assuming the calm exterior of the objective scientist simply interested in *facts* has historically been a wonderful way to oppose social justice, especially with regard to women‚Äôs rights. Because, blaming working women for bad things is not a strawman: it is the face of insidious sexism. And the faux objectivity that tells women to be quiet please, because now we have to examine if equality really is a good thing after all is part of that.

&gt; the complaint was more about your (to me unwarranted) fervency and hostile tone

Yeah, well. I mean, I‚Äôve been trying to find a way to say ‚Äúsorry‚Äù without making a fake apology (‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you thought I was hostile‚Äù), but at the end of the day (nothing against you personally obviously), but I think I‚Äôm ok with being exasperated and impatient with sexism ‚Äì even the insidious kind that comes from otherwise well-intended people. Because it‚Äôs a learned behaviour that maybe does need a bit of push-back and a bit of shaming for the benefit of, if not the person with the sexist view, then the young girl lurking. But also because, you know, there really is no way I could have phrased the suggestion that blaming childhood obesity on the rise in women‚Äôs participation in the workforce might be a tad bit sexist that would not have been downvoted into oblivion ‚Äì I mean, we both know that, right? In which case, guns blazing might be a good tactic for getting attention ‚Äì or at least keeping one‚Äôs self mildly amused ;)

And it's not just the right, but the left too in the form of outrage-mongering feminist articles which are extremely shrill and moral authoritarian in tone, yet often fail to cite any evidence for claims (videogame infuence on violence, Matt Taylor, shirtgate etc). 

Britain is no stranger to moral panics, we do them quite well,  Mary Whitehouse was a pro.

I just think this is a complete non-starter. It's nothing to with trust as far as I'm concerned. It's about not being able to get drugs or as much money. I don't see how begging being illegal makes an authority untrustworthy.

&gt;Approaches that treat addicts with compassion; like not prosecuting them for possession.

They aren't usually. The point is that you sometimes have to arrest them to be able to force them into rehabilitation when there is no other option. 

&gt;But really you need to stop people becoming homeless in the first place, that means more social housing, better work rights. It should be criminal for the state to allow people to become homeless because it is a dereliction of our collective responsibility to one another. We wouldn't willingly allow a child to go without education and a family life, why does that responsibility go away when someone reaches 16?

Yes I don't disagree with any of this. But there will always be homeless people and there needs to be a framework to deal with them.",0,1417435887,null,0,false,0,cmhtr1y,t3_2nxett,t1_cmhtr1y,t1_cmhtluq,null,1425741538,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So you arrest them and their friends for begging and then expect them to go through state funded programmes?
Many have mental illness and reject the notion of state support.

&gt; The point is that you sometimes have to arrest them to be able to force them into rehabilitation when there is no other option.

Rehab never works if people are forced into it.
We need to accept addiction and prescribe drugs that actually satisfy their addiction so they go to authorities rather than living on the fringes of society.
We used to prescribe heroin, but trying to appear hard on drugs left us with the methadone programme (which is arguably a less safe drug, in its pure form).
There are similar schemes that can be set up if you see addicts and homeless people as human beings in need of compassion instead of a problem to be dealt with.

&gt; there will always be homeless people and there needs to be a framework to deal with them.

Less spent on petrol and car maintenance, means more disposable income.

People have more of their money to spend, that spent money is taxed.  State gets tax, peoples lives improve with more purchasing power.  

With a well designed network, more people will feel safe to have a trip into town.  No worries about being crushed to death, just a connected network of lanes allowing people of all ages and abilities a safe, welcoming way.  Short journeys make a lot of sense when a safe network is available.

Roads wear much slower saving a huge amount on repair / maintenance.

If we had similar rates of cycling to the Dutch (27% of all journeys) , motor traffic in towns and cities across the country would see a drastic reduction in traffic.  Driving would be nicer, less time in traffic jams.  Which makes the roads better for people using a motor vehicle.  The London underground could have overcrowding reduced when there's an inviting connected network of cycling routes.

[""Who else benefits from the Dutch cycling infrastructure""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSGx3HSjKDo) is a good video of highlighting how better designed streets help everyone including the young, old and disabled.

If I had kids, I wouldn't want them cycling to school.  But we could reduce the volume of traffic blocking schools during peak hours and have children being more active, if the network is there.  [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrQ-d2PBUto) showing children cycling to school, without PPE (helmets high vis etc), without needing their parents to take them.

The two videos I've linked too are from an interesting (well I think the channel's interesting) Youtube channel of someone capturing ""cycling culture"" (which is much more casual - most people cycling don't see themselves as ""a cyclist"" they're just using a tool that makes the most sense).  

Then there's improvement in air quality, less accidents and deaths.

Rodgers has come out just the last few days talking about how Gerrard can't play every game at his age, yet Gerrard has had more minutes than any other of our midfield players this season....

So it's hard to trust what Rodgers says right now. I think he's finally seeing how shite we are, especially when Gerrard plays every fucking game. So hopefully he's seen sense.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;If that is the case, then will you respect the democratically expressed will of the Scottish people and lay aside any campaigning for independence?

OK so let me get this straight, because Scotland voted No by a small margin (55-45 is *not* exactly a large margin and you'd be an idiot to think it is) *all* the 1.6 million people who voted Yes should arbitrarily give up campaigning for independence and either join the unions and start flying around union jacks and singing rule Britannia or put up, shut up and bite the pillow because the union's going in dry. No. If you abandon something you believe in because you are not the majority then you are an invertebrate little bitch with no principles.

[I will start out with this chart](http://s3.mirror.co.uk/mirror/ampp3d/articles/indy-ref-by-age.jpg). Look at this chart for a second. It shows that the one demographic that swung the vote was the over 55s, and even with the 55-64s it's a rather close race. This is no surprise as it is this group that is the most likely to consider themselves British and have a fondness for the Union. The older you get, the more unionist you are, an oversimplification, yes, but it generally works. They swung the vote. Now unless every single Scot suddenly turns out to be cursed with life ala Captain Jack from Doctor Who, the older generation are going to die. Give it another ten years and this effect will take effect and there will be a rise in people (maybe pushing the magic 51%) who support independence. The SNP are now the UK's third largest party in terms of paid up members and you are a fool to think that you can use the referendum of 2014 to gauge Scotland in 2024. Opinions change within ten days let alone ten minutes. The simple facts I'm getting at are these:

* Yes campaigners are *not* going to shut up and give up because that's not how democracy works. You do not give up your beliefs and principles because you are in the minority, if that was the case democracy would not work because everyone will be voting for the same things and people over and over again.

* Demographics change, opinions change and a referendum result in 2014 is not something that must be set now and forever to the end of time. Opinions on independence will be different five years, ten years, twenty or forty years henceforth. 2014 is not an eternal bellwether. People will die, people will come of age and the result will vary either way, and even people I know who voted no admit that in the next couple of years, Scotland will most likely vote yes if given the chance.

So get your head out your arse for a second, just because we voted against independence in 2014 does not mean we'll always want to stay in the union and the result, given the chance in another decade say, would be completely different.

So the landlord looks around. There's: 

* LettingAgentA who charges 5% a month for advertising and property management, with a ¬£250 'admin fee' to the tenant. 

* LettingAgentB who charges 5.5% a month for advertising and property management, with a ¬£200 'admin fee' to the tenant. 

* LettingAgentC who charges 6% a month for advertising and property management, with a ¬£150 'admin fee' to the tenant. 

* LettingAgentD who charges 6.5% a month for advertising and property management, with a ¬£0 'admin fee' to the tenant. 

But really the admin fee means nothing to the Landlord. He has a property, and people need property. They'll rent it regardless assuming it's not a total shithole. So the actual decision the Landlord has to make is choosing one of the following:

* LettingAgentA who charges 5% a month for advertising and property management.

* LettingAgentB who charges 5.5% a month for advertising and property management.

* LettingAgentC who charges 6% a month for advertising and property management.

* LettingAgentD who charges 6.5% a month for advertising and property management.


So which does he pick? He picks 5% because that's the cheapest to him, even though it's a shit deal for the tenant. It works because letting agents have a monopoly on any given property. 

So if we were to change it so it all had to be in that % the landlord sees then it would end up being fairer overall because the Landlord would be choosing what's in his best interest and the tenants best interest. There's no way to separate them.

From the article

&gt;Ratnage received a 20-month sentence suspended for two years and 300 hours community service

I honestly don't see what the issue is here?  Am I too much of a neolib, disliking prison as it's expensive and incredibly ineffective for the cost.

&gt;Blue collar crime and white collar crime - one of these things often gets fullest possible punishment under the law to act as a deterrent (""make an example of the criminal"" etc) and the other does not.

But this is the thing, by punishment you are meaning sentencing right?  It comes down to the fact that *if a man has nothing to lose, he has everything to gain*.  If I stole a chocolate bar, got a record for that, then I would not be able to do my job.  My career that has had 30,000 hours of my life thrown into it, would be suddenly worthless.

These people apparently were earning ¬£100k pa, that isn't going to happen any more, apparently the pension has collapsed too.  ¬£120k is only about ¬£500 pcm on an annuity at the moment.

There is a bit of a moral issue, if you have rich people, they can simply be 'fined'.  But myself, I'd rather have 3 months in prison, keep my lifestyle, not lose pension fund etc.

Compared to losing all that, 3 months in prison is nothing.  A friend of mine spends 3 months working on the rigs for a lot less than that.

If on the other hand, you have no ¬£100k pa job, the consequences of your crime are quite little by comparison.

For years, the City of London has taken for granted its status as Europe‚Äôs primary financial centre. But as rows over immigration intensify and political pressure mounts for the UK to reform or revoke its membership of the EU, City opinion leaders are growing nervous about its future role in Europe.
With one or two exceptions that is the sentiment expressed in a new Financial Times online debating forum. The FT City Network, launched in recent weeks, comprises more than 50 of the City‚Äôs top bankers, insurers, asset managers and policy makers, as well as a coterie of financial technology entrepreneurs.

In the network‚Äôs first online debate, most participants argue that Britain‚Äôs departure from the EU would damage London and the broader UK, and imperil a fragile European recovery.
Sir Win Bischoff, former Lloyds‚Äô chairman and now head of the Financial Reporting Council, writes: ‚ÄúThe City will lose some of its relevance and a lot of its international dominance if clients and counterparts in its hinterland of Europe chose not to deal with it or are prevented by various regulations from doing so.‚Äù
Jean-Pierre Mustier, the London-based head of investment banking at Italy‚Äôs UniCredit, describes the prospect of Britain exiting the EU as ‚Äúa catastrophe, though actually much more for Europe than for the UK‚Äù. Companies from across Europe would find it harder to access finance without a single-market link to the City, several participants in the debate argue.
The discussion comes amid a crescendo of disagreement over EU membership among politicians and the general public that has spooked many in the City. Barely five months ahead of next May‚Äôs general election, an anti-EU, anti-immigration agenda has helped the UK Independence party secure its first two MPs.
But several members of the network take the opposite stance on immigration. Guy Hands, chairman of Terra Firma, the private equity firm, says: ‚Äú[Many of] the 2.2m EU citizens who work in Britain [are] skilled workers in London. An exit would place a question mark on the future of these workers, with some maybe being forced to leave. Such an exodus would intensify the skills and labour shortage that Britain already faces.‚Äù

Many in the business community are trying to take a pro-European stance early on in the mounting discussion about the UK‚Äôs EU membership and ahead of a possible 2017 referendum. Business leaders are conscious that they were blamed for not being sufficiently vocal in arguing against Scottish independence ahead of a September poll.
John Cridland, director-general of the CBI employers‚Äô lobby, stresses the supporting role that the City plays for broader business. Leaving the EU would ‚Äúlessen [the] standing‚Äù of the City and undermine that support for growth and jobs, he writes in the debate. ‚ÄúThis ‚Äòinvisible infrastructure‚Äô has been fundamental to British firms accessing capital as they reap the benefits of having a globally competitive financial market in their own backyard,‚Äù he says.
Colm Kelleher, who runs Morgan Stanley‚Äôs investment banking operations from London, highlights the disruption to investment and job creation from not knowing between now and the Conservative party‚Äôs slated referendum in 2017 whether the UK will remain part of the EU. ‚ÄúUncertainty and a drop in investment is hardly the best way to fuel the UK‚Äôs recovery and reduce one of the highest deficits in the G20,‚Äù he writes.

A minority of participants in the debate think the City can continue to prosper whether or not the UK retains EU membership. The strongest anti-EU voice is Helena Morrissey, chief executive of Newton and chairman of the Investment Management Association. ‚ÄúThe City won‚Äôt just survive but prosper if the UK leaves the EU,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just not credible for big City institutions to threaten to leave ‚Äì the same threat was made when we did not join the euro and not only did they stay, but it proved the right call.‚Äù
UniCredit‚Äôs Mr Mustier agrees that there would be minimal downside for the City. ‚ÄúEurope will have difficulties developing a financial centre truly competing with London, both in terms of human resources expertise and infrastructure,‚Äù he says.
The FT City Network was launched in October as an invitation-only panel of financiers and policy makers. The network is scheduled to meet in person twice a year, with online debates timetabled monthly.

Everton....well, seemed most people leading up to the match realized that it would be a difficult match. People weren't thinking it was a guaranteed win, they expected a fight and people knew that we could in fact win/lose/draw that match going in.....

also happy that ilori is healthy, he needs minutes. i truly see him as the future of the right side of the defense. 

last thought, i though brad smith was back at liverpool right now because they recalled his loan so he could sign a new contract? i believe it was late october (around the 20th or something) that he was recalled.

I'm glad they took the three points though, as it will lessen the burden of getting a result tomorrow (although if we get thumped like Swansea have done to us before a few times in recent years...that's a different matter).

That said, we have to break this tradition of losing away at some point, and we can't leave it too late in the day. We need to be far more willing to enter into a firefight rather than invite pressure against the likes of Swansea. For the most part I think the squad largely lack the finesse to operate entirely effectively on the counter - it's a real ballache because you'd imagine that Traor√©, Phillips and Hoilett are perfect for that, but I think each of them is technically unreliable for either holding it up at the end of a run,waiting for the others to scramble into play, or for finding that one touch shot to find the back of the net. That being the case we will need to scheme our way up the field or failing that use blunt force - Henry, Barton and Fer (centrally, for god's sake) swapping in Mutch should be capable of this.

As much as I think all of the home games between now and new year are winnable, it wouldn't surprise me to see us drop them. The only team we have beaten 'comfortably' is Aston Villa, Austin has scored as many goals as their entire team so far. I'm not sure we will experience many instances of us battering a team into second place this year. I think Caulker is a rock, but I have pretty grounded expectations of the rest of the cast at the back (including Dunne, regardless of his supreme efforts so far).

It's a very nice twist of fate that we're being served up so many six pointers in such a short space of time though.

What issues are you trying to treat? You mention hypersensitivity but few of the ingredients or products are targeted at that. Overall your routine seems to be on the harsher more irritating side. If you have acne this could well be a function of poor skin barrier function (keeps water in, irritants and bacteria out).

IMO your first priority should be construction not destruction. The SCA beginners routine is for those with basically 'normal/ average' skin and is targeted towards straightforward acne vulgaris, not atopic eczema, rosacea or contact dermatitis.

**Gentle cleansing**
Many with hypersensitive or very dehydrated skin cannot or should not use foaming cleansers at all. In some cases this can extend to shampoo and body wash, do consider the effect of bubbles or residues washing over your skin in the shower. If you wish to continue with a foaming cleanser you might experiment with the Asian system of working up a lather in your hand with a 'net' and using the lather to cleanse. Basically the product is very diluted but still effective.

**Exfoliation**
Ideally minimise exfoliation because it damages the skin barrier, if you need to the gentlest options are lactic acid or urea, both are found in healthy skin and hydrate as they gently exfoliate. Urea particularly is suitable for skin prone to eczema because it does not need an acidic pH. Some of us here have used and liked the NIP+FAB glycolic fix pads, but at least two who experienced overexfoliation/ irritation using them every day. Less can be more.

**Oils &amp; lipids**
Linoleic acid has some useful and interesting properties but [oleic acid is not beneficial for the skin IMO.]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/2nle28/eli5_so_is_oleic_acid_bad_for_acne_prone_skin/) The skin barrier lipids are primarily ceramides, also cholesterol, cholesterol esters, long chain and very long chain saturated fatty acids. No natural oil is rich in these. For OCM consider adding an emulsifier to your blend or using a ready made product so it rinses clean with water, no scrubbing required.

**Breakouts**
Have you spoken with your family doctor about breakouts? They can prescribe 4% niacinamide and 15% or 20% azelaic acid both of which are anti inflammatory and gentler than most commercial acne products. These can both be used in rosacea, so are well suited for breakouts in hypersensitive skin. Niacinamide can help strengthen the skin barrier by increasing ceramide synthesis.

**Diet &amp; lifestyle**
Alongside that are you consistently meeting or exceeding ALL our government's recommendations for healthy eating and lifestyle? This can help keep any systemic inflammation to a minimum, strengthen the skin barrier and help calm inappropriate immune responses. Obviously you would have to work around any triggers for your epilepsy.

in the prem, we play leicester, arsenal, man u, sunderland, burnley, and swansea. if we can pick off wins against at least leicester, sunderland, burnley and swansea, we will pick up 12 points plus i think we can nick a win off of arsenal or man u, both not looking their strongest just yet and we need the victories. 12 points is the minimum we need, but 18 would be a dream. 

our january seems to be not so bad with leicester again, west ham, aston villa nd sunderland..so if we win the games we have to in december, and then in january, we're still in the hunt for top 4. then february becomes very interesting. february is when we'll have additional cl games and we play everton, man city, southhampton and tottenham...most difficult stretch of the season that will be. so hopefully by february, i would like us to be in the hunt of top 4 and make these game mean something. from there we will see how this season turns out.

As you said we could be looking pretty good, maybe not comfortably mid-table but not in the position also where we have to beat Man City at home to have a shot at staying up.

We could also be in real trouble if we lose the next 6 games (but then we are in the same position any time in the season I suppose). 

As you said I don't imagine we'll be in the position where we will win all our home games. I don't see us comfortably beating any of those teams. I think we will probably scrape through to January with about 19 points (8 points from 6 games isn't a big ask IMO) Maybe 2 wins and a draw ? Sounds achievable.

The Press are building up those 3 games to be deciders on who is getting relegated but IMO I think they won't have a massive impact on who goes down (as there is another 1/2 a season to go). 

But it's times like these when you think about how easy it is to be a Chelski fan. Only worrying about champions League and how much you'll win the Premier League by this year.

I genuinely believe that if we can stay up this year we can really kick on the year after. Out of the promoted teams, (apart from a striker) I believe we are the strongest and there are several teams in the lower half of the league like Villa who I feel are below our standards.

* FUD = Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt
* FUDGE = Wilsonian Fudge of the Treaties by David Cameron

Effectively,

&gt;*""You only have to Fear, Fear itself.""*

Any Brexit however must safe-guard:-

* Single Market Access
* FDI

Which means joining EFTA and adopting the EEA (European Economic Area) Treaty for full access to the Single Market, AFTER leaving the Political Union of the EU/EZ (""Ever Closer Union"").

Let's take the statements one by one:-

* **Sir Win Bischoff**:-

&gt;*‚ÄúThe City will lose some of its relevance and a lot of its international dominance if clients and counterparts in its hinterland of Europe chose not to deal with it or are prevented by various regulations from doing so.‚Äù*

This assumes Brexit = No Access to Single Market for Finance.

* **Jean-Pierre Mustier**:-

&gt;*‚Äúa catastrophe, though actually much more for Europe than for the UK‚Äù.*

Again why would it be a catastrophe if Brexit maintained access to Single Market (incl. Finance)?

* **Guy Hands**

&gt;*‚Äú[Many of] the 2.2m EU citizens who work in Britain [are] skilled workers in London. An exit would place a question mark on the future of these workers, with some maybe being forced to leave. Such an exodus would intensify the skills and labour shortage that Britain already faces.‚Äù*

Again, if Brexit maintains access to Single Market then it abides by Freedom of Movement of Labour (NOT PERSONS). Why does this man also assume Brexit will break Single Market access?

* **John Cridland (CBI)**

&gt;*lessen [the] standing‚Äù [and] ‚ÄúThis ‚Äòinvisible infrastructure‚Äô has been fundamental to British firms accessing capital as they reap the benefits of having a globally competitive financial market in their own backyard,‚Äù*

Let's remind ourselves of the CBI's support for joining the EURO: [Wrong Then, Wrong Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTv7UoK8oJY). Again I repeat the question how does the UK and City lose influence not being in the Political Union of the EU?

* **Colm Kelleher**

&gt;*‚ÄúUncertainty and a drop in investment is hardly the best way to fuel the UK‚Äôs recovery and reduce one of the highest deficits in the G20,""

Uncertainty = F.U.D. Uncertainty will continue due to the failure of the Eurozone, due to political intractability of the Political Union as well as global shocks. The UK would be more stable out of the EU failing political union with more ability REFORM and more agile policy management. The choice is a Democratic choice to exit ""Ever Closer Union""; it's not a financial choice which makes no difference if the Single Market access is secured.

=

Opposing the FUD and FUDGE:-

* **Helena Morrissey**


&gt;* ‚ÄúThe City won‚Äôt just survive but prosper if the UK leaves the EU,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just not credible for big City institutions to threaten to leave ‚Äì the same threat was made when we did not join the euro and not only did they stay, but it proved the right call.‚Äù*

She is right about the EURO, but she should specify that Single Market access and protection of FDI are key to ANY BREXIT plans, which must include those.

* **Mr Mustier**

&gt;*‚ÄúEurope will have difficulties developing a financial centre truly competing with London, both in terms of human resources expertise and infrastructure,‚Äù*

The EU specifically. Europe would still use London as a Financial captial. Most EUROS are trading in London and the Chinese RMB.

The Chinese have said themselves, it does not matter about EU membership to the Political Union, it matters that London's history, expertise and geography and willingness to:-

Don't talk nonsense. Holland has embraced the bike and has a head start on providing proper infrastructure for it. Other countries are blessed with wide boulevards that they have been able to section out into cycle paths without narrowing car lanes or demolishing buildings.

Most countries are in much the same boat as us. They have lots of cyclists, especially in flatter towns and cities. In other towns and cities they have fewer cyclists.

It would be *unacceptable* for me to appear in front of customers as a sweaty mess, and without anywhere to shower when I get to work, that means cycling is out. End of discussion. Not sure what I could do about that. No showers at work, nor are there are any gyms near my office that I could join (to stop at and use the showers before cycling the final half mile to work or something).

I say this as someone who used to cycle to university, and then to work. Then our office moved and although I could (just about) cycle it in terms of distance, I wouldn't be presentable by the time I got there.

On the other hand my Dad's employer has a staff gym and he could cycle in early and grab a shower before going into the office. One of that company's sub-factories is literally just down the road so he can (and does) cycle to that without needing a shower when he gets there. You work with what's available. But the ""infrastructure for cycling"" isn't just about cycle paths. It's about encouraging businesses to install showers, bike racks, secure storage and help their staff get to work on bikes.

By way of example my office is next door to an NHS admin centre. That centre has a smoker's shelter but no bike racks or secure storage - the *NHS* isn't helping it's staff cycle into work!

I am a big big fan of this range. I own the cleanser, toner, night cream and day moisturiser with SPF.

**Eucerin Purifyer Cleanser** - is the most gentle cleanser ever. It's pH 5.5, so it isn't stripping, has no smell and has the tiniest of foams. I can't recommend it enough!


**Eucerin Dermo Purifyer Toner** - It's a 2% lactic acid toner, meaning it could work as an AHA. I don't know what pH it is, so I don't know if it is the right level to exfoliate. My skin prefers Glycolic Acid, so I use this toner in the morning as kind of a skin-balancer. They have a serum (*Eucerin Dermo Purifyer Concentrate*), that's supposed to be stronger (don't know much about it though), but as I don't need more AHAs I didn't buy it. Here's a list of [High Street AHAs](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2a3d0u/updated_post_list_of_ahas_you_can_find_on_the/) you can find in the UK. The Stridex you ordered is a BHA. 

**Eucerin Dermo Purifyer Adjunctive Hydrating Care SPF30** - So, I bought this a while ago and I loved it. Then I started breaking out, and I attributed the breakout to it. I was super wrong, it was another product in my routine. So I chucked that out, and I've now repurchased it.

**Eucerin Dermo Purifyer Night Care** - I haven't tried it yet! But the [*bisabolol*](http://www.paulaschoice.com/cosmetic-ingredient-dictionary/definition/bisabolol) in it intrigued me :D

You probably didn't get on well with the Glycolic Cleanser. It won't have done much in the way of exfoliating, as you wash off any beneficial ingredient.

Couple of points here - Holland having a head start is besides the point.

As for not having the space.... many Uk roads can take cycle paths. And interestingly the ones that cannot (due to space restrictions) often have a lower speed of traffic and as such you could argue don't need cycle paths.

false,Paludosa2,null,null,"First things first, let's be clear about what these VIP City figures said and if their words hold up to scrutiny or not:-

The City ""Heavyweights"" here are quoted (included for convenience above):-

&gt;*"" if clients and counterparts in its hinterland of Europe chose not to deal with it or are prevented by various regulations from doing so...""*

How does that happen if the UK still has access to Single Market aka acquis communautaire the legislative body still applies?

Answer: It does not.

&gt;*‚Äúa catastrophe*

Again, how would it be a catastrophe if trade and regulations are not changed? Why is Political Union being conflated with Single Market access?

And so on with the others. Namely their views are hyperbolic conflation and irrelevant if the above applies, and quite possibly worse, deliberately misleading.

&gt;*Being inside the EEA (the Single Market) means adopting all the Single Market directives, which make up about 80% of EU legislation while have no say in how they are drafted.*

Completely wrong. Finance is a global industry, the regulations are made in such cities as BASEL not Brussels. There are components that are made in Brussels and those apply MORE to the EUROZONE. To quote EU expert Dr. RAE North:-

&gt;*The international origin of EU law is no more evident than in the financial sector. It has been recognised that, in a few cases, the EU ""uploads"" its international financial rules but, in many cases, it ""downloads"" them from international bodies. The EU's CR IV Package on the adequacy of banking capital is an example of ""downloading"", the source being the Basel III agreement crafted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).*

&gt;*The new regulation also applies to the EEA but, outside the EU/EEA, the essence of the CR IV package would still apply to Britain as a party to the Basel III agreement. It would ""download"" it directly, rather than via the EU. The process is rarely visible to the popular media and almost entirely unknown to the general public.*

Hence if anything the UK staying in the EU as a ""peripheral member"" to the EZ is losing influence. By contrast exiting the EU the UK assumes more roles in global finance bodies. To again quote Dr. RAE North:-

&gt;*On the other hand, the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) is largely of EU origin. It is seen as a building block of ""Fortress Europe"" ‚Äì a more protective European market sheltered from competition.*

The direction the EU is going is not going to help the City of London and in fact it's the G20 that is more important in converging financial regulation across the world, globally led iniative eg US, EU and further afield in the future, China.

The irony appears to be the same argument concerning influence actually applies MORE to the EU than to the UK as the UK loses influence in the EU and regains it equally to the EU for it's national interest outside of it given the schism between EZ and non-EZ members. Namely it's neutral and ultimately likely beneficial for the City to exit the EU.

&gt;*And free movement of people is an EEA obligation*

Freedom of Movement of **Labour**. It's a big difference. Secondly, there's more additions here where the UK regains more control of Migration Policy powers.

To summarize:-

1. City heavyweights are irrelevant and fear-mongering if Brexit maintains access to Single Market
2. The UK is losing already low influence in the Political Union as a non-EZ member.
3. The UK would exert more control on the Finance bodies at the global level (considering Mark Carney is already head of one such committee...) outside of the EU and given Finance is Global Industry is the necessary to ensure competitiveness &gt; Protectionism of the EZ.
4. Bonus: Great controls over Migration policy can be achieved in the EEA vs in the EU. Or to compare more controls than David ""Control"" Cameron can achieve via Treaty Amendment in the EU Political Union.

*Facepalm* That's precisely what I'm saying. The people who already cycle to work en masse (places like Cambridge with high uptake) are doing relatively short distances on the flat and/or they have showers at work and/or etc. They are the people who live near work or have enlightened employers who provide relevant facilities. I used to be one of those people, then work moved away from me and it's not practical to cycle to the new site.

I know one major retailer who doesn't even have staff toilets - rather than have staff in on a 6 or 8 hour shift with lunch breaks, they run 4 hour shifts where you arrive, work and leave again. That means you have to turn up ready and presentable for work - *there is no sink to go and wash in*.

That's the sort of thing people are up against.

&gt; As for not having the space.... many Uk roads can take cycle paths. **And interestingly the ones that cannot (due to space restrictions) often have a lower speed of traffic and as such you could argue don't need cycle paths.**

Having lived in rural areas for much of my life, I can state that is categorically untrue. Many of the narrower roads that cannot take cycle paths are not especially slow for traffic. I live on a small road which people treat as their own private race track. An appropriate speed would be 25, I've seen people do 50. Which accounts for the two shrines to dead cyclists, both in the past 2 years. The council did then install a footpath. Which is not a cycle path. Cyclists still have to use the road, despite it being cyclists who got killed. Fucking council cretins.

I do agree that an adjustment to expectations nationally would be good - that if everyone cycled, we'd all get used to people just being a little bit more smelly and no one would notice. That wouldn't be a bad thing.


I notice you didn't respond to the example about the local NHS building, which opens another can of worms.

I have cycled, now I can't. If I did, not only would I be a sweaty mess, but there is literally nowhere to leave my bike when I got here (it would be impractical to bring it into the office). That even the NHS across the road don't offer this to their staff beggars belief! There are tons of new business parks going up with huge car parks and not a cycle shed in sight... that needs to fundamentally change if we're to facilitate a meaningful shift to cycling. People won't cycle if they can't bring their bike in the building and there's nowhere vaguely secure to lock it...


It's not about ""not wanting to"". I would love to cycle in. But even if the council sorted out the roads so I could get there without dying, I'd be faced with limited facilities to change and make myself presentable for work, and I'd have to get the bus home because my unsecured bike would have been nicked from outside the office... the latter two problems are not within the remit of the council.

In a meta-analysis, researchers from Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) and China Medical University in Shenyang for the first time combined 27 studies and found strong indications that fluoride may adversely affect cognitive development in children.

&gt;Summary from the Lancet article...

&gt;**Neurodevelopmental disabilities, including autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, and other cognitive impairments**, affect millions of children worldwide, and some diagnoses seem to be increasing in frequency. Industrial chemicals that injure the developing brain are among the known causes for this rise in prevalence. In 2006, we did a systematic review and identified five industrial chemicals as developmental neurotoxicants: lead, methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, arsenic, and toluene. Since 2006, epidemiological studies have documented six additional developmental neurotoxicants‚Äîmanganese, **fluoride**, chlorpyrifos, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, and the polybrominated diphenyl ethers. We postulate that even more neurotoxicants remain undiscovered. To control the pandemic of developmental neurotoxicity, we propose a global prevention strategy. Untested chemicals should not be presumed to be safe to brain development, and chemicals in existing use and all new chemicals must therefore be tested for developmental neurotoxicity. To coordinate these efforts and to accelerate translation of science into prevention, we propose the urgent formation of a new international clearinghouse. from [The Lancet (the world's leading medical publication)](http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laneur/PIIS1474442213702783.pdf?id=baak8dkBlaiXPhJTjuTsu) (sic: My emphasis (Free registration req'd for full article))...

This is why I say we should aim to encourage cycling...we cannot encourage it by asking nicely and hoping things just magically happen, we can only encourage it by getting off our arses and installing facilities and making it safe for everyone. To dismiss the possibility is a race to the bottom if you ask me.

And just to repeat myself - i accept (for whatever reason - some a little lame, some genuine and understandable) why you cannot/wont cycle. Its not my job to persuade you personally to do so especially when its not safe.

(However, between what happened to Scottish Parliament 'constituency' seats at Holyrood in 2011, and the uptick of support since the referendum, the First Past the Post bias will very likely swing in the SNP's favour in May).

And I'm pretty sure that UKIP's demands to curb immigrant numbers is *not* something that the SNP would support; they tend to be happy with the free movement of people within the EU for one thing. Some of the more rural parts of Scotland actively seek immigration, to keep their communities alive - when the SNP looks at the numbers, they do so because they actively want them to be higher.

For instance, from the [SNP site](http://www.snp.org/blog/post/2014/may/what-yes-vote-means-immigration): ""In Scotland, when we see an increase in our population given our history of depopulation, we celebrate the good news ... Only 20 or so years ago there was a real fear that our population would dip below five million. Although our population is currently growing at a healthy and welcome rate, there is still a realisation that our population levels remain more fragile than south of the Border.""

There is a large middle ground where the court isn't convinced either way - usually due to a lack of evidence (particularly when it is just one person's testimony against another's).

You do realise that any sort of fear leads to decreased investment and destabilisation of financial markets right?

&gt; The UK is losing already low influence in the Political Union as a non-EZ member.

Complete and utter bullshit, if anything the UK has incredibly amounts of influence within the EU.

http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/01/30/uk-britain-eu-idUKBREA0T18O20140130

&gt; *Presenting what it said would be an annual scorecard of Britain's progress in Europe, British Influence said London was on track to meet nine out of 10 of its EU policy goals and was a force to be reckoned with in the 28-nation bloc.*

&gt; *London had been successful in 20 areas and failed in only four.*

--

&gt; The UK would exert more control on the Finance bodies at the global level (considering Mark Carney is already head of one such committee...) outside of the EU and given Finance is Global Industry is the necessary to ensure competitiveness &gt; Protectionism of the EZ.

The EU doesnt stop Mark Carney from doing anything, what the fuck are you talking about?

Also London is not constrained by EZ regulations so pretty much everything you have said so far is straight up false.

&gt; Bonus: Great controls over Migration policy can be achieved in the EEA vs in the EU. Or to compare more controls than David ""Control"" Cameron can achieve via Treaty Amendment in the EU Political Union.

Except free movement of labour is a founding principle...

In conclusion, you have basically said that ""The people that work in The City of London are wrong and im right"".

false,TheConnivingPedant,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"You know, your posts tend to be rather difficult to understand, but as far as I can make out the thrust of your argument is that financial regulation is decided at the international and not EU levels and that the UK would have more influence over the global regulatory framework outside the EU and not in it.

The first is fairly true, especially as, until recently the EU has been worried about things other than financial regulation and immediately post crisis they've been implementing the new Basel and G20 frameworks. But this situation would change if the UK left. One of the main reasons that the EU is not doing more financial regulation (other than what they think is necessary to stabilise the Eurozone) is because the UK opposes it and the Commission want to keep the UK, especially the pro-EU City happy and on its side. If the UK leaves then that political calculation disappears and the EU is free to implement some of the stronger regulation that places like France were pushing, or at a minimum to bring EU regulations in line with American ones. This leaves the UK in a conundrum. It can either stay in the EEA and be forced to adopt the regulations that the City does not want, or it can leave the Single Market altogether, which nobody wants.

The second point is patently false. Global influence is largely a matter of size. Inside the EU, the UK is part of the largest economy in the world, and one which sets most of the manufacturing and trade standards used by the rest of the world. Because the EU want to keep the City happy, they give them huge power over EU financial regulations and hence the international negotiating position of the largest economy in the world. Outside the EU, the UK is at best a medium-sized economy with a newly founded reputation for making stupid decisions. It will be marginalised while the EU and the US made decisions that suit them and their interests. China don't come into this and won't for a long time. Their financial system is not liberalised and not well integrated with the rest of the world, nor would they be support the kind of minimal regulation that the City likes.

Yay, full employment!

Except that it solves nothing and it's just unpleasant and manipulative double speak and lies.  Which is why I'm amazed he hasn't tried it.

In the end, if a full time job isn't paying enough to live on, it's not paying enough, and I find it hard to believe people would argue with that statement.  Yet I know they will.  Usually about paying people what they're worth and in doing so, judging huge swathes of people to not deserve to exist.

Same goes to a lesser extent to the work providers, 'training course', workfare, sanctions, and all the other bullshit that's showed up or massively increased in the last five years.

for the most part, most people know how to apply for work and will do it.  Those that won't or can't, sadly don't get any help from work providers, they're 'parked' in a corner, while all the resources go on pretending to help people who are already easy to find work for, so that they can claim their ¬£4000 or so in bonuses for finding work.

I have to wonder, if they took a quarter of that and say, offered jobseekers ¬£250 to start work, ¬£250 in 3 months, and ¬£500 on their 1 year anniversary in full time employment, do you not think that would be more of an incentive?  Especially when at the moment, if you find work, your JSA is immediately stopped, and you're expected to get to and from work and pay all your bills for six weeks with no money, until that first pay hits your bank.  No wonder Wonga's doing alright and in bed with the Tories.

Remember we're doing this already, but at more than four times the expense, and the money's going to private companies instead of jobseekers, who'd be spending it on work clothes, travel to work, etc.

I swear I could take 10% of IDS's budget and make it ten times more effective, simply by not hating humanity, and only living to punish the unfortunate.

First of all **we**, what do you mean by **we**? NI is not a net contributor to the UK. Do you even understand what was bailed out? It was not simply Britain bailing Ireland out; but britain shoring up RBS, the Royal bank of Scotland and more specifically, it's Subsidiary,[Ulster Bank](http://cached.newslookup.com/cached.php?ref_id=120&amp;siteid=2112&amp;id=2210725&amp;t=1370813396). 

&gt; With losses of ¬£4.5bn last year, Ulster Bank was the largest contributor to today‚Äôs announcement of RBS‚Äôs ¬£8.2 bn of losses. It is also the black hole for the majority of RBS‚Äôs losses since nationalisation. Losing money every year, it has racked up an eye watering ¬£16.6 bn of losses (operating losses plus non-core impairments), a number that exceeds the often-reported ¬£14 bn taxpayers‚Äô paper losses. ^[Source](http://leftfootforward.org/2014/02/rbs-the-accidental-british-bailout-of-the-irish-state/)

It was the reckless practices of Ulster Bank that led to the situation.

&gt; While Ulster Bank accounted for only 3pc of RBS's assets in 2007, it has generated almost ¬£13bn (‚Ç¨15.3bn) of bad loan losses.
&gt; 
&gt; **""The severe losses suffered by certain UK lenders in Ireland partly reflects the aggressive lending practices they employed here,""** 

said Philip O'Sullivan, chief economist at Dublin-based NCB Stockbrokers.^[Source](http://www.independent.ie/business/world/ulster-bank-soaks-up-a-third-of-rbss-45bn-government-bailout-29177658.html)


Do you believe that somehow Britain was acting in some altruistic benevolent fashion or that it was acting in its own self interest, ring fencing UK banks.

&gt; The tale of RBS is the accidental British bailout of the Irish state. **The Irish government guaranteed Ulster Bank‚Äôs depositors on 9 October 2008, putting Irish taxpayers on the hook for the losses rather than the British taxpayers as RBS‚Äôs shareholders.** However, Ulster Bank was not put into the Irish ‚Äòbad bank‚Äô, NAMA, in 2009 because at that time its losses were quite small.
&gt; 
&gt; It was only a year after NAMA was set up that the losses in Ulster Bank began to soar. The decision not to put Ulster Bank into NAMA will have been based on the accounts of Ulster Bank in 2008 and 2009, which means the audit should be under much greater scrutiny. ^[Source](http://leftfootforward.org/2014/02/rbs-the-accidental-british-bailout-of-the-irish-state/)

As we know, when Lamela is playing on the right wing he isn't quite as quick to drop back and help the right back as Lennon is. This can leave us quite exposed at the back since space will open up in the right back position when the right back has to move out to press. When this space opens up, the right sided center back has to shift over to cover which then unbalances the back line and creates numerous holes for the opposition to exploit. 

I loved watching Lennon drop back into the right back spot when Chiriches had to press, since it maintained the cohesion of our back line and left us a little less likely to be taken apart by a well placed through ball and run in behind. 

Granted, this didn't happen every time, and there were a few moments when Fazio had to shift over to cover, but it was just my overall impression of Lennon's play.

We, the British taxpayers bailed out the Irish Republic. I trust you understand this simple concept in the complicated world of high finance; My 4 year old seems to have grasped it anyway. Maybe I should pretend exasperation with a few italics and bold or something.

&gt; **""The severe losses suffered by certain UK lenders in Ireland partly reflects the aggressive lending practices they employed here,""** 

Same as every other bank doing business in the south...

If only Dublin was in charge of its own economy, then they might possibly have moved to prevent the over heating, over leveraged economy from collapse. Sure at least they could blame it on the bankers &amp; Brussels I guess. Gombeen nation.

&gt;Do you believe that somehow Britain was acting in some altruistic benevolent fashion or that it was acting in its own self interest, ring fencing UK banks.

Hey we could, and did, take care of our own. The majority of UB's losses came from the economic collapse in the Republic. Obviously being the closest neighbour we would have been affected. Didn't allow it to swallow the public finances though. Which marks us out immediately as being more capable than the Republic. But then that's what happens in a functional union of nations, we have the capacity to work through it.

&gt;I have a sneaking suspicion that you know fuck all about the nature of international finance skunkd, that you have a mistaken belief that global capitalism fits into your bizarre little sectarian fantasy land.

Our resident know it all here to tell us how shite we all are, and sectarian we are for daring to question the idea. Let it all out wee man. The only sneaking thing you hold is a disdain for anything that sets NI out in a good light. A lot like the catty replies from Republic-based accounts.

A problem the EU faces is that there are differences between economies but I think the solution is to raise up the bad rather than to close the borders.

Frankly if opening the borders makes things worse for some British people and better for some foreigners I don't see this as a problem.

Naughton - Fed - Vert - Davies

Bentaleb - Mason

Azza - Eriksen - Chadli

Soldado

I think we need three in the midfield.  Chelsea are very strong there with Oscar, Cesc, and Matic and I think we need to occupy the center of the pitch in numbers to try and avoid being overrun and dominated through the center.

As for the wings, I think we need to match up and focuse on the fullbacks.  Chadli matches up well physically with Ivanovic, and I think he has the intelligence to take advantage when Ivanovic goes up the pitch.  Azza to help out with Hazard and marginalize Azpi like he did Baines.  

Mason, I chose because I want to see him use his tenacity and energy to hound Cesc and try to force him out of the match.  Whoever partners with him obviously I'd like to see hanging back and watching Oscar and supporting the fullbacks when they push up.

Soldado up top because I think he's more suited to the lone role than Kane is. Kane like playing a bit deeper and dropping off the CBs, and without someone ahead of him allowing him to do that, I don't think he'll be as effective.  Soldado does things faster in terms of his passing and I think he would handle being up top best.

Defensively, my worry is pace.  We have none of it.  Vert isn't slow, but compared to their marks, Fed, Naughton, and Davies sure as hell are.  We'll need a lot of support from our DM and the wingers if we want to handle Hazard and Willain, as well as Remy, who I assume will start up top in Costa's absence.",0,1417457054,null,0,false,0,cmi1th3,t3_2nyam3,t1_cmi1th3,t3_2nyam3,null,1425737703,4,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,4

false,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"Saying he was reckless when he came on is a bit fucking different than saying ""He has done more than Lamela and Towsend ever have for us in the Prem"" which is an absolutely absurd statement that's getting spammed up by retards.

And the AVB comparison is equally absurd. Name me one successful attacking midfielder in world football who doesn't get any goals or any assists. I'm not saying 5-6 goals or assists; I'm saying literally someone who can go through an entire season with dozens of appearances and get literally 0-2 combined goals and assists.

I mean, christ, even compared to someone like Antonio Valencia who isn't exactly prolific, Lennon doesn't create or score enough goals. In all competitions--including the same shit competitions that Lennon and Townsend played in last season--Lamela has already dwarfed their *combined* total of goals and assists from last season. 

And for the love of god don't give me the workrate argument, because fucking Eriksen worked just as hard yesterday and he also manages to consistently produce goals. Working hard can be instilled into players, but a 27 year old is not going to suddenly learn how to score goals or create them on a consistent basis.

I like Lennon, by the way. I realize that it's not ALL about goals and assists. His movement is underrated (though so is Lamela's), he links well with teammates, he makes better decisions than he's given credit for. I'm objecting to an absolutely astonishingly dumb statement that reactionary idiots are lapping up.

false,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I see quite a few people calling for many changes to the midfield for this game, and I really don't agree with that.  We hit on something that started to work well in the second half of the Stoke match, and we should use that to build.  This means largely sticking with the core of players that got a chance at the weekend.  I could see Coutinho or Allen perhaps making way for another player, but I wouldn't change them both at the same time.  Coutinho can have Lallana or Gerrard come in for him, and likewise Allen can be swapped with Can, assuming we continue on in the 4-2-3-1.  Lucas needs to stay IMO, he's the one that made our defense start to feel more confident as the game went on.  He really is a very intelligent player defensively (aside from his penchant for giving away dangerous free kicks at strange times, but I think that's more to do with him being a half step slower than he maybe thinks he is than anything) and protects his back line very well.  I'm also really worried for Lambert playing 270 minutes in like 10 days, that's brutal.  He looked absolutely dead towards the end of the last match, I don't think he can last 90 minutes again right now.  Maybe give him 60 minutes to go hard and then bring Borini in.  Sterling is another I'm really worried about playing too much.  He looked better against Stoke but I really don't want to overplay him or risk really burning him out badly.  I think he has to play a big part in this though.  I think we can plan a couple of good subs to help rotate and rest players in this match too.  I'd start something like:

-------Mignolet--------

Johnson--Skrtel--Toure--Moreno

---------Lucas----Allen---------

Hendo----Gerrard----Sterling

-----------Lambert-------------


I don't particularly like Allen and Gerrard together as I think Allen slows the game down at the same time Gerrard speeds it up, which leads to one or both being yanked out of position.  Maybe with them playing in different roles rather than right next to each other this gets mitigated though.  

Lallana on for Sterling and Borini on for Lambert at 60-70 minute mark unless circumstances dictate a big change.  We need to protect Sterling a bit and Lambert is hitting form, something no other striker can say for themselves right now.  We can't run him ragged too quickly and the game *should* be pretty safe by the time we make both changes.  Borini coming in really lets us defend from the front with his work rate too, which is good.  Lallana needs to begin to get integrated into the team now, he's way too good to be getting wasted on the bench.  For me, in this game, it came down to Lallana OR Gerrard in the interest of not making too many changes at once, and I think Gerrard's seniority gets him the spot.  Lallana gets 20-30 minutes here and then starts against Sunderland, probably with Can as well, although changing them both in at the same time is basically a total reconfiguration of the midfield and probably a little bit risky right now.  Eventually Lallana is alternating games with Gerrard and eventually could end up playing alongside him in place of Allen (Henderson sits with Lucas, Lallana and Sterling on either flank, Gerrard through the middle).  Again, all assuming we stick with the 4-2-3-1.  I personally think a natural 4-3-3 is better for our players at the moment and when everyone is fit the diamond is the best option, but Brendan really loves his 4-2-3-1 this season so I'm sure we'll continue on with it at least for now.",0,1417458962,null,0,false,0,cmi2ugx,t3_2nxqew,t1_cmi2ugx,t3_2nxqew,null,1425737224,7,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,7

Who did I fight?

&gt;Well that's as good a roundup of the Republic's economic planning as any I've read. Roundabout way of saying so mind.

Absolutely, large capital inflows and the agglomeration of investment in investment along with decreasing competitiveness (as seen in Ireland's NX) are serious issues that need to be dealt with well in advance.

I'm not sure what any of this has to do with our discussion though? I suspect your emotional attachment to things leads you to regress any discussion back to topic you like, it's not a topic I understand much, I've never had deep sectarian feelings myself. 


Should we get back on track and discuss shortcomings in demographic methodology in the deprivation index? I think perhaps we could move on to suggesting measures for how NI can solve its ongoing spending problems. In my opinion it is a great opportunity to cut the public sector (as the public sector wages are considered to have the lowest Keynesian multiplier) as this was not done in Ireland, rather, investment expenditure was cut for political reasons. But in NI, the local parties have a get out clause in that they can blame Westminster for forcing fiscal responsibility, and perhaps the electorate will be sympathetic with them on the issue.

Not anywhere a MOTM but I really like Vlad as a impromptu RB.  He has pace for CB and he loves going forward and he sent in some good crosses so I want to give a shout to to him.  Kane created so many opportunities and was stuck to the ball most of the game, he proved very difficult to dispossess.  Lennon gave 110% and I think he should start every game till about the 65 min mark, giving the effort he did Sunday and depending on the score make way for Lamela so he can continue to grow, but that boy needs to get smarter.  Thought Mason kind of had a off day, but he was still tenacious so I loved the attitude.  You can't be at your best every day.  He has good tactical vision which is nice to pair with that of Eriksen.  Soldado did a lot of things right, but I am reluctant to say any kind of streak is broken.  Go net some goals against Chelski then I will feel really good about him.  Nabil had some great interceptions and tackles and is showing steady improvement.  It was just a great outing to watch, plus I had just gotten my complete spurs PJ set (top, bottom, and moccasins) the day before so I am chalking them up as good luck.  I think Mason was our worst starter that day and he did not even have that bad of a game.  Vlad is putting in some good crosses from RB also which I think should be noted.

I must admit that while I think I have a pretty good perspective on the game, my struggle is remembering who did what.  I may notice one player making the same mistake on a number of occasions but I won't necessarily remember that it was him making that same mistake.  

Something that helped me in that regard was live tweeting a game.

Here's a copy of a letter from the BBFC addressing the subject directly:

The BBFC responded to research on female ejaculation submitted to the BBFC by Feminists Against Censorship:

""If I may clarify our position, the Board does not in fact take any view on whether or not female ejaculation exists. As you admit in your letter this is a controversial and much-debated area with a range of views being taken amongst medical professionals. At the most basic level, however, the Board is content that the pornographic tapes so far presented to us as examples of 'female ejaculation' are in fact nothing other than straightforward scenes of urination masquerading as 'female ejaculation'. This has been confirmed by a female sexual health expert who the Board has consulted on a range of issues relating to videos intended for the 'R18' category.

Quite the opposite of attempting to confront the issue of female ejaculation in a reassuring, sympathetic or informative light, the tapes in question appear to be nothing more than a cynical attempt on the part of porn distributors to get around the constraints imposed on urolagnia in sex tapes by the current interpretation of the Obscene Publications Act. It is worth noting that the kind of material that the Board has been cutting is regularly sold as 'urolagnia' in other European countries (France, Germany, Netherlands, etc) where there is no equivalent legal restriction on the use of urine in sex videos. Indeed, although videos featuring urolagnia are very much in evidence on the continent, videos purporting to show 'female ejaculation' seem to be invisible. Perhaps female ejaculation is less exciting (or profitable) to pornographers and their viewers than urination? Generally speaking sex videos of the type encountered at 'R18' neither seek to inform nor educate about female (or male) sexuality but merely offer graphic (and grossly distorted) views of sex for the arousal of viewers. Indeed, as you acknowledge in your letter ""much of the material [the Board] passes with an 'R18' certificate does not necessarily represent the sexual experiences of all women"".

To conclude, the Board remains open minded about the issue of female ejaculation but we have yet to be presented with any pornographic video that has convinced us - or our medical advisor - that it consists of anything other than an excuse to display scenes of urolagnia. Such scenes are regularly found obscene by juries in the UK and therefore cannot be classified.""

Lucas absolutely must start, we look so much more balanced with him holding and while he isn't much of an influence in the final third, he often transitions play well between defence and attack, which has been lacking a little this season.

I'd also be tempted to give Lovren another shot with a proper holding mid ahead of him especially seeing as it's the bottom team, but I'd also be happy to stick with Skrtel Kolo.

Either of Enrique or Moreno, and then Glen at right back.

Going forward I'd like to see Lallana start, we haven't seen nearly enough of him. Though Brendan could have rested Stevie with a view to playing him midweek which I hope means he'll get a attacking role, rather than the dreaded Gerrard Lucas double pivot.

Reckon we'll see something like:

Now kinky porn is banned, are you going to change your habits?

Combine this law with what we know about GCHQ and the powers to spy on all innocent citizens, which even local councils are abusing:

https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2nrmeb/uk_police_force_accidentally_admits_it_spied_on/

If local councils are abusing this power, there are other much more powerful people doing the same.  People at the very top of society are now much easier to blackmail if they watch a bit of kink.  People organising protests, actions groups or anything are really easy to snuff out if they happen to still enjoy a bit of kink.

Are you campaigning for a living wage . . . . hope your porn habits are clean.  
Are you campaigning against a corrupt local MP . . . . hope your porn habits are clean.
Are you campaigning against extremist movements, racism or even campaigning for both . . . . hope your porn habits are clean.

Because people a bit higher up can access your data, they can now do you over because you like porn.  More than just emotional blackmail, this is now a chance to legally blackmail someone.

&gt;  urination in various sexual contexts; and female ejaculation.

If I want to watch a woman piss on another woman, I should be able too.  So should you.  Real ejaculation or simulated ""squirting"" should not be illegal, but they are as of now.

No more golden showers for the UK, just showers and a law that has just criminalised millions of people that want a wank.

- Giffgaff for a good non-contract cheap monthly SIM, uses O2's network so you have good coverage (if you need more data, then get Three - but I dunno how much coverage you'll have in rural Gloucestershire)

- Don't transport your car, and if you get one over here remember to learn how UK roads work before tiffing out on your own. They are very different from yours, especially in the countryside where you will be. Perhaps invest in a few driving lessons and learn to drive a manual.

- I dunno much about accommodation in Gloucestershire (which, by the way, is pronounced Gloh-sta-sha, not Glow-cester-shyre). In any case I don't reckon you'll have much bother finding a flat to live in.

To your point, Rodgers has dealt with rotation in the Championship before, but nothing like this where the opposition in midweek is just as cruel as the teams at the weekend and you also lose players for (and at, it seems) international breaks. He's clearly still getting to grips with the balancing act of having to manage a player like Gerrard, his new signings (who he has been unimpressed by whether they've been impressive or not) and the near-complete loss of pace from our strikeforce and clinical finishing from our midfielders/wingers. 

Despite what I've put down, I'm hoping for rotation. Lambert needs a rest, Borini must start and players like Can, Moreno and Markovic need to be able to show they can graft like the rest.

OK, my view on this subject is that as long as it doesn't endanger life and both (or more) of the participating parties are consenting the state should have absolutely NO power to say what people can and cannot film and distribute. 

The ""THINK OF THE CHILDREN!!!!"" argument is also obscene and has gone on too long, all of this censorship, porn filters and 'obscenity laws' is just an excuse for parents to not do their job. A lot of the MPs who pushed this through, and members of the general public who support these kind of laws, are either completely out of touch with modern culture and/or are parents who are too lazy to do their job, making sure that their children are not viewing obscene material themselves.

Generally, not in this issue to do with porn, the general public should not have to suffer under a nanny-state due to the incompetence of the few.
