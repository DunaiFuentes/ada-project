That's not true at all. The Human Rights Act that the Tories will repeal incorporated the ECHR into British law allowing British judges to interpret the ECHR how they want since 1999. 

However Brits can still appeal to the court in Strasbourg which can overrule British judges. What the Tories want is for British judges to have the final say, I.e for the European court to lose any right to tell the government what to do, I.e the government wants to be able to ignore the rulings that don't go it's way making the whole concept of bringing a case against the government entirely pointless. If you lose they declare that justice has been served and if you win they will whip their parliamentary majority and dismiss your decision and you lose. 

In other words the Tories no longer want to comply with the ECHR if they don't have to -  we may as well leave the whole convention if it's possible for the government to overrule any human right it contains without a fuss.

* Henderson is so damn good

* Lovren needs to get his head on straight, so many careless challenges and poor positioning

* Balotelli looked ok, but I think he should have come on for Couts and we played 2 up top

* Lallana is amazing with the ball at his feet, think we are just seeing the beginning of his usefulness for LFC

* Loved Stevie hounding down that ball down the right at around the 90 minute mark and the back-heel to Balo. He has been in poor form but that makes me remember this is still our captain and he isn't past it just yet.

There were several moments throughout the game that reminded me of our fluidity and dynamism from last season; lots of one touch passing, fast counters, etc. A lot still to fix and improve (e.g. Balotelli learning to float a yard on side so he can make an attacking run for Sterling or Coutinho's through ball while staying on side) but...dare I say it?...some green shoots of recovery showing?",0,1412439477,null,0,false,0,cl09h3v,t3_2ia71v,t1_cl09h3v,t3_2ia71v,null,1426687345,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I started going to a lot of regular games with my mates when they were back at the bottom of League 1 with minus points and I've seen them smash teams so seeing Lallana, Lambert and Lovren play makes me very happy.  Saying that, I'm not overly convinced with Lovren, I thought he would be much better when he joined. I'm wondering if it has to do with the defensive coaching over anything else.  

I am from daaan saaaf so I'm obviously not a local fan despite supporting Liverpool all my life.  I think Lambert has a lot to offer and I'm glad he got game time, I rate him massively but sitting on the bench isn't going to help.  Seeing him start today was great and I think he can be a worthy player for us.  It's a shame Balotelli and Lambert have similar styles of play as Balotelli should get the nod over Lambert on paper.

Properties that stand empty for more than 1 year are now subject to a 100% surcharge on their annual bill. There's also a 50% discount available for up to two years for anyone who can prove that they are actively marketing their property for sale or let.

I encountered a couple of issues with this though. If you can prove that the empty property is inhabited for at least 25 days a year, you can claim a 10% second home discount indefinitely, and the checks in place for those looking to claim this weren't very stringent. You could literally just send an email stating you lived in the property for at least 25 days and the discount would be applied to your account, no questions asked.

The other issue being that the surcharge (and most of  the discounts available) is applied based on the property's last date of occupation, regardless of whether the tenants or owners had changed. This led to a lot of contact from people who had purchased properties that had been sitting empty for some time, and were unable to move in due to work needing to be carried out, suddenly being hit with massive Council Tax bills.",0,1412440843,null,0,false,0,cl0a1mu,t3_2i9fnc,t1_cl0a1mu,t1_cl089qx,null,1426687079,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

A more important question to ask (IMO) is ... Who/What implemented the time-lock?

1) They wouldn't stop selling the oil for any length of time since, it would decimate their economy (GDP of Saudi is 750 billion, UK's is 2.5 trilling, US north of 12 Trillion) b) China won't want much more if the west economy is not growing.


2) Lets assume that your estimate of prices per litre is right (and it's really not, £3-4 over the time it takes for new fields that are now *very* viable and then a drop after that) it would spur us quite rapidly to remove the dependency we current have on oil and make other technologies more viable.

Its not a ""special kind of evil"". Its war. War is very often sickening especially when its performed by disorganised nations, especially when its borne of a civil war. That's a special sort of hate that brews and festers over the years and then explodes suddenly.

If you genuinely think the Dresden bombings were fine and dandy then you're wrong. They were akin to war crimes. I don't blame the allies because at that point they were really fucking far gone, the Nazi's were terrifying and they were four years into a bloody war with their homes rubble and their family and friends dead or dying. That grief does stuff to you. You have to appreciate how the mindset gets tainted by experiencing years of war. Its hard for us to empathise as we live in civilization.  

I'm not saying what ISIS are doing is fine and dandy. I fucking hate ISIS personally speaking... but if I'm going to be objective about it then its not all too dissimilar from other wars of recent years, decades or centuries.

false,bruisedbollocks,newbadge,,"A disappointing result for so many reasons, but on the basis of how we played, it was exactly what we deserved. We didn't create enough clear chances, we didn't dominate possession well enough and we didn't seem to have a focused or well-coordinated gameplan. Let's give credit to Burnley though - they came out and played against us and made us look very uncomfortable at the back. A well deserved point for their hard work.

Despite the disappointment of what most will consider 2 points dropped, in the long-term we can take lessons from this and improve:

Firstly, our gameplan was all over the place today. It didn't look like the whole team was playing to the same strategy - were we defending deep and then attacking quickly and directly? Were we to push higher up, press the ball, control possession and attack patiently? Whichever it was, we often got caught with too many men up the pitch, our defensive line too deep and Burnley having a lot of space to play the ball in our half. I think a lot of confusion came from being a goal up, and as we haven't held the lead much this season, the players didn't know exactly whether to play for a third or just to negate Burnley's play.

Leading on from this, our possession play was poor, especially in the second half. Our defenders often played it direct, trying to start a counter-attack, only to give the ball straight back to Burnley. We really needed to be more patient in building up play and retaining the ball, especially when we were a goal up and needed to kill the game off in a professional manner.

Our defending and goalkeeping also looked weak today, against a team that had only scored once previously. The full backs didn't get a great deal of support from the wingers, and the space for crosses was a problem. The first goal we conceded was really poor, and I think Kasper needs to be more prepared to dominate his area when crosses come in. His positioning at the free-kick for the second was highly questionable, giving a huge target for Wallace to aim at and giving himself very little chance of getting back over to the other side of the goal. Our only clean sheet this season has come when Ben Hamer was playing, and after a shaky start to the Stoke game, he become more commanding and made a couple of stunning saves to protect our lead. Kasper started this season fantastically, and his performance at Stamford Bridge was top class, however he may start to find his position under pressure soon.

A couple of last points. Our final ball into the box was really pretty poor today, and especially considering how Ulloa has got his goals, we should expect better delivery from the wide areas. Finally, our substitutions - I absolutely hate to criticise Nigel, because he really is a fantastic manager as shown by his record with us. His team selection for the start of the game was positive and vindicated by Schlupp scoring, and Mahrez getting a goal and an assist. However his decision to bring on Knockaert for Mahrez when we were 1 goal up and needed to show some more grit, retain possession and frustrate Burnley, was a strange one. I think it would have made more sense to bring on another central midfielder and reduce the amount of space Burnley were getting, and it would have given the message to team that we need to close ranks a bit rather than throwing men (and the ball) forward so much in the last 20 minutes. However, I realise Knocky could have come up with another goal to finish it off and we would be praising Nigel's balls for staying so attacking - it was just a gamble that didn't pay off, and I'm not going to hold it against him.

Overall, yes let's be disappointed with our performance, but hopefully our team will learn some valuable lessons, become more wily as individuals, and make better collective decisions in future games.",0,1412443098,null,0,1412447531,0,cl0azqc,t3_2ia89f,t1_cl0azqc,t3_2ia89f,null,1426686637,11,false,lcfc,t5_2ukrz,11

Exactly. Like /u/dirtyewok posted -there might be much more behind the scenes than just we wanted rid of him. 

I don't blame the lad - imagine, you've come in from Schalke. You were the poster boy of Gelsenkirchen compared to all BvB's stars (rough quote from bild IIRC). The number 10. You're playing the best football of your life, at AMC and playing for a CL side in your NT's country. Then you move to Tottenham - get forced into a bit part role here &amp; there with intermittent appearances and even though he had a MASSIVE outside chance of getting close to the German NT with all their abundance of current &amp; potential midfielders - it makes more sense of him to move.

Still miss him though. And still feel despite a lot of people saying he's a complete donkey - he has moments that AREN'T average at all. The talent is clear to see, and has been seen in Germany. Yet on the other hand, you'll get the same people defending Townsend saying that his faults can be trained out but not Holtby? Holtby possesses much more natural talent and brains than Townsend - different position, but you get my point. 

I feel half of Lewis's problem was his insistence (or the coach) of him playing at CM/DM. I don't even remember the quote, but it sounded like he was saying ''I will play anywhere to get games'' rather than ''I really want to play at CM''. Why did Schalke play him as a AMC otherwise? He's not got the discipline, positioning or stamina to press for 90 minutes from that deep - so he's bound to look mediocre. Yes, people will say ''but he played xxx amount of games at AMC and failed to impress'', but it's different when everynight you're not sure if you're a MC, DM, AMC, or what. At Schalke he knew - I'm the 10. The focal point, AMC. And he excelled.

I want him back. If anything, you can't go wrong for 1.5m (or essentially a free transfer) and having a CL side's main AMC and ol' German u21 captain as your backup, can you? And to let him go for less than what, 5m future fee IIRC? For that price it's a no brainier to keep him and play him if he was genuinely happy at the club.

&gt; As a household survey, the CSEW does not cover groups such as the homeless, or those living in institutions such as prisons, who have potentially high rates of drug use, and problematic drug users who are unable to take part in an interview.

So they asked people 'do you take drugs'. Less people have been answering 'yes', indeed they also then extrapolated this limited sample size to the population as a whole. It's completely unreliable in its methodology. 

I'd infer that this is largely because the penalties for most in terms of things like community service have been steadily marching up. So people are far skeptical about answering.  


There is however, precious little evidence that the governments interdiction strategy is doing more than pushing prices up and making purity of sully fall. Both of which directly harm people. 

In fact its the purity of supply that kills people. Indeed, keeping the market unregulated and giving suppliers in the market incentives to cut corners is what causes most of the harm of drugs along with all the organised violence used by this unregulated market to police itself.

That's what kills people.

&gt;___Spiral Scratch___ was the seventy-first BBC Past Doctor Adventures novel. It was written by Gary Russell. It featured the Sixth Doctor and Mel. This was the final novel featuring the Sixth Doctor. It is also the final Sixth Doctor adventure overall, as the ending leads directly into the television story *Time and the Rani*.
&gt;The novel reveals the circumstances behind the Doctor's regeneration into his seventh incarnation, which were left a mystery in the televised version of the event. According to the novel, the Sixth Doctor was already dying by the time the Rani boarded his TARDIS after the events of this story, and her attack propagated the Sixth Doctor's inevitable death sooner than it would have occurred. As of 2013, it is the only account of the regeneration in a BBC-licensed venue.

If anything , todays game showed that the fickle rodgers bashing that has gone on for last few days can stop ... 

For me rodgers made a few very good tactical tweaks 

1. Coutinho playing next to gerrard worked. Our transition from defence to attack was much better.

2. Lambert although was bad at finishing  stil looked good... he doesnt have the pace but he does make runs for the midfield which is so important... 

3. The way gerrard moved around and became a attacker at later stages  with lucas sitting in defence when we were protecting the lead might be a good way to  go and will help us hold on to leads much better..

false,bloodyforeigner,null,null,"In my experience of living in Montpelier for a year then St Pauls for 8 months, these stats can be misleading. It's often a question of who the crimes are directed against, and the nature of them. Montpelier, I never had a sniff of any crime at all.

St Pauls was interesting - I think we witnessed a getaway car full of robbers pull up for them to change outfits outside my house once, saw the odd crackhead/tweaker in the vicinity, lived right near a house full of weed dealers with a permanent open-door policy, and once even heard what we think were gunshots. Some cars got set on fire outside my friends' house once - this goes some way to explaining why St Pauls retains its 'reputation', which is regrettable because I think some people (not everyone) equate 'rough/dodgy area' with 'lots of black people', and in this regard St Pauls does not do much to refute the stereotype (although the strange goings on are definitely not limited to immigrants and the like). I'd like to see St Pauls shed this image because it's a vibrant and fun area with a real community spirit.

The key thing though is that living in St Pauls I never, ever, once felt in any way threatened, even walking down Ashley Road past the Criterion at 3am. I suspect that a lot of the crimes in the area are drug related, because due its location in relation to the rest of the country, Bristol (including St Pauls and Easton) are in many ways hubs for the SW drugs trade. There are, I would hazard, some pretty serious operations going on. But therein lies the contradiction - anything high-level that might be happening behind closed doors is really unlikely to affect you as the man on the street because you aren't involved in anything. This stuff goes quite deep into the underworld and if you're minding your own business and don't mind the 24/7 smell of weed (not a problem limited to St Pauls) then you will be alright. Same goes for Easton. St Pauls always felt to me like a safe and friendly area, and I lived with female flatmates who didn't have any problems walking around at night - at least no more than you would expect elsewhere.

I know one guy who got mugged in St Pauls but it was some pissed-up suburbanites who were just passing through on their way back from the Black Swan.

I know this isn't directly relevant to St Annes but it's a similar sort of thing - there are some rough around the edges parts but Bristol isn't somewhere you're overly likely to get your head kicked in just standing about. Don't be put off by scare stories. 

As an aside, I now live in Southville - known as 'Lower Clifton' by some - favourite of the yummy mummies and old bohemians who don't have to squat any more because they've got a bit of dollar. Southville had 167 reported crimes in August 2014 and everybody you speak to will tell you Southville's a family friendly utopia while St Pauls is a cesspool of degeneracy. Don't take crime stats at face value.

The Langton pub is also an ok place, if you're into paying a visit to the local. 

The schools and church have nice couple of events every so often. 

If you have to head into town/Kingswood every day for work then the feeder road/Whitby road do get rather busy so you may get some delays from that.

my opinion of it is, is that this is a poor decision from the school because it isn't inclusive (huge Ofsted no-no). I wouldn't call it racist, though.  

Even if the specific aim of the trip was to do with ESOL, native-speakers of English should have been given something of equal ""value"" in terms of fun and a treat. Actually, even better, gone with them.  

This matter has been reported to Ofsted and I can guarantee they'll slam the school for this.  

I understand where people on this thread are coming from with the support for the school's decision, but as you have admitted you're not ""edjamacators"" (like that word), I feel the need to say that when it comes to practice and Ofsted, the school is way wrong here.

false,aoeuisnthd,null,null,"Turns out Mr. Noble is the most valuable midfielder in the PL in terms of providing actionable passes to his team.

I know statistics are hard to quantify in football -- and this article addresses that to a degree:

&gt;Coming into this weekend, Yaya Toure, Manchester City's all-everything central midfielder, leads the EPL in passes per 90 min with 92.8. That is a lot. It would be logical and intuitive to conclude that Toure is the most influential passer in the EPL. But that distinction actually belongs to West Ham's Mark Noble, despite the fact he is way down at 26th in the EPL with 63.8 passes per 90 min.



&gt;As is the case with most stats—and this is particularly true of stats in soccer—context is key. Manchester City passes 606 times per game while West Ham only passes 385 times per game. By taking each player's passes per 90 and dividing it by their team's passes per 90 we can create a pass usage rate for each player which represents the share of their team's passes a player contributes.

&gt;It's also important to note that usage rates are not meant to be predictive of future performance or indicate relative ability among players. But they are useful data points that help provide context to a player's performance within his team. To make an analogy to the NBA, a league with which ""usage rate"" is more commonly associated: Player A scores 20 per game on a team that averages 110 on 107 possessions while Player B scores 18 per game on a team that averages 80 points and 80 possessions.

We started the game great. 5 mins and got a good goal all things were looking good for a 0-4 cruise.... 1 minute later Taylor passes the ball to Dundee guy and all he has to do is shot it into the net :| . 

I couldn't really see the second goal so can't say. 

Should of made it 3-1 i have no idea how it went wide. 
Overall first half we had the upper hand even with Dundee looking scary coming forward and having Taylor possible getting confused what team he plays for multiple times. 

From what I saw looked like a hand ball on Taylor ( ? ) Penalty so I guess it was fair. 

2-2 We responded well. Dundee had a load of good chance that gave us a scare or two. 

3-2 came eventually we had gone a good lot of possession and chances on goal and aggressive corners. Was a beast header by Goodwillie who had a great game today again. So glad we got him over SuBo. 

Collum Still proving that anyone can be a ref. Horrible pass back right on the line should of been a indirect free kick but nothing given. About 3 obvious corners not given and was not consistent on the fouls and cards he gave out either way. Just a bit of a shit ref. Again.... 


Overall Fuck Taylor. Can't have him fucking up at the back so often. Need to sort something out before the next game until Anderson comes back. Maybe putting Hayes LB,  Considine  RB,  Reynolds CD With  Considine ? or something different be he can't start the way he's playing now.

2. Fazio - Again, nothing gets past him. Quite slow so you'd think he'd be weak in Fifa, but does great.

3. Chiriches - I think this is more a testament to Fazio if anything, but he's been great for me. Works well with Fazio as he's pretty fast, so any of the lobbed through balls get taken care of (that Fazio can't get to).

4. Chadli - Not as fast as most wingers, but he's got the strength to get past defenders. Lovely shot on him so anywhere around the box is a potential goal if you can find the space.

5. Lamela - Does well enough to be worth a shout in a PL team, but he's nothing to get excited about. Worth the money (I paid 950), but there are far better out there. He's fairly fast, but with very little strength. His shot's great inside the box and he has good enough dribbling to get there, but finding the space to shoot is difficult.

Most critical reviews and discussions i have read put it down to RTD caring about character development and canon (almost to a fault) to the point where he sometimes lets the story take a backseat to it. And on the other side of the spectrum Moffat seems to really focus on the story being told and sometimes lets his character development and canon take a backseat because of it. I seem to really agree with this analyses for the most part and think that is why we see more of a disconnect from season to season lately.

To comment though on your last bit about the companions i think of all the responses ive read yours makes the most sense in a ""in universe"" explanation which is what i was looking for. (not ""duh old dr who never had recurring characters so RTD was stupid for making that a thing"")

I think the team must change for the good of Doctor Who because I think the standard has become very low.

Actors are brilliant as always. Capaldi is excellent in what he does, but the character development is just weird. Jenna is full of emotions and I think overall she is better actress than Karen Gillan. I am satisfied with her character although lot of people aren't.

false,al455,mccoy,McCoy,"Kill The Moon is one of the most cerebral Doctor Who scripts we’ve has in years, and honestly, I can’t even truly describe why. The abortion metaphor isn’t new to sci-fi, and that’s exactly what we had here. Fair enough, a basic decision that has a lot of weight: Life/No life. In Kill the Moon, one new alien life, or the risk of no life on an already metaphorically dying Earth. The ‘Abort’ message when Clara hits the button, a nice little irony as it's an anti-abortion of the alien life. Or perhaps it should be read as an abortion of the Earth itself? Most certainly the old Earth as The Doctor informs us later, with the new outlook of human beings going out to the stars. Also rather nice that the male cast members all get killed, leaving the ‘abortion’ decision to the remaining women, all representing different ages. 

I know certain people who had a bit of a problem with the 12th Doctor’s characterisation, being overly severe and harsh, particularly to Clara. I’m sure they’ll appreciate her speech to him at the end of the episode, putting him in his place from her point of view. Honestly, I’m conflicted on it. The Doctor is certainly more alien as of late, in this episode for example I felt some serious channelling of Tom Baker, who always played The Doctor as alien and kooky. I like The Doctor being alien, but I also think Clara’s right. He is the best of us, he should help us. But then again in this instance he was right in letting the human race decide its future. Argh! I can’t decide, but frankly I appreciate a script that makes me think and feel like this.

The use of Courtney was well handled to an extent. Thematically it worked; being a bit of a tipping point for the Clara/Doctor argument, as well as having her represent woman-kind at the resolution. But in the episode itself it felt a bit cheap putting her in the TARDIS, off to one-side, and then having her on a TV screen anyway!

 In conclusion: a competent Hinchliffe-y opener, with touches of Troughton-era base-under-seige,  then turning into something far more interesting in the second half. I’m still mulling a lot of it over so definitely more of a ‘thinky’ episode than say ‘Time Heist’ or Sherwood. Next week should balance it out with a more horror-style romp, plus I’m a sucker for a Mummy so I’m looking forward! Series 8 as a whole I am loving so far, this episode more in the vein of ‘Into The Dalek’ and ‘Deep Breath’. Variety is the spice of life, and Doctor Who is nothing but varied this series!

I... I don't quite know what to say to that. That was terrible.

Second-hand space shuttle, third-hand astronauts... random 100 nukes? Where the hell from?

""Unicellular bacteria""? That's a bio-luminescent spider the size of a dog, for fuck's sake. That's not a single cell.

Also, if the spray bottle didn't work in a vacuum - it wouldn't have - then... why was there vapor still coming out of the nozzle while Lundvik was all like ""It's a vacuum! It doesn't work!"" The whole ""spray bottle kills germs so it kills teh spiders lelele"" thing made me cringe so hard.

And where the hell did these spiders all come from? They just materialized because the bug thing was going to hatch? Why the hell did the moon even gain that weight? Was that embryo really that heavy? Even then, that wouldn't have added 1.3 billion fucking tonnes, would it? And would that even add enough gravity to add the ""Earth gravity on the Moon"" gimmick?

I really stopped taking this mess seriously when the convenient panel slid off the table onto the open door window which was apparently enough to seal the entire place. Holy shit.

Then Clara deliberately and purposefully asked the Earth ""Do you want to all die?"" and didn't appreciate it when they said no. And how the hell did every light get turned off? How did they know that every light on the other side of the Earth wasn't on? It's not like everyone has a device capable of picking up that ""broadcast"" or anything, and even if they did, they couldn't all possibly turn off every light.

And the whole beach scene. Jesus... the episode would've been a lot better if the tides suddenly shifted all over the place and the water just went apeshit. At least then they wouldn't be focusing so much on the bullshit ""the entire moon disintegrated and disappeared"" up in the sky and the squid thing disappeared away and a new moon was there wow seems legit!

Clara quit. Oh thank god, she made a good decision for once. Good on her.

~~And oh jesus christ the next episode is an invincible zombie on a space train. I'm cringing already.~~ **EDIT: Forgive me, it was great.**

Such a cop out that the creature had no bad effects on the Earth. The moon/egg shell just disintegrates? 

I was hoping that either the shell would fall down and destroy something or that there would be huge disasters from a lack of tidal gravity but noooo everything is fine and dandy because Clara made the right choice and wanted to be nice. 

Clara's way of counting votes from Earth was stupid, she can only see half of it and how does she know which places have their lights on or off? Doesn't matter in the end because she wasn't going to listen to the whole population of the Earth anyway and risk killing them all.

How convenient that the creature managed to lay an egg bigger than itself offscreen and as soon as it hatches.

Also why was the moon getting heavier? Where was the mass coming from?

We know there are fixed points where things cannot change otherwise the universe will unravel. We know that there are times of flux where anything can happen and anything can change. The Doctor can usually see these moments for what they are and he can see the possible futures due to flux.

This episode seems to be altogether something different based on what the Doctor says. He says the moment is hazy and he cannot quite make out what is to happen/has happened. He says the decision of what happens to the moon has technically not happened yet despite the fact that he has been to the future and been on the moon. The decision had not happened until he lived his life to his Twelfth Incarnation to help make the decision.

I would like to think of this new kind of time moment as a quasi fixed moment of flux or something to that effect. The event seems so pivotal as it could potentially destroy the future but not enough so that it actually unravels the universe. It is somehow both fixed and in flux which could explain why the Doctor has such a hazy view of the possibilities.

I think the Doctor was afraid to take this decision away from humanity because then it wouldn't be their choice. They wouldn't feel the weight of the consequences if it was someone else's decision. I also think he might be feeling the strain of constantly saving the Earth and the Universe and wanted to see if he could trust anyone else to make those decisions (more specifically if Clara could).

And in the Agatha Christie episode, The Doctor explains to Donna that Agatha Christie could die and her books would instantly disappear because time is in flux).

Essentially, the moment the TARDIS lands in a location, unless the moment in time is a fixed point, time enters a state of flux where the future after that point is unknown.

 Only redeeming quality of this episode was towards the end when the Doctor sees the path of the Human race clearly and when Courtney left the tardis(good riddance, she's one of the reasons why I found this episode so hard and cringeworthy to watch)  and most of all, what redeemed the episode was claras speech; what amazing character progression we got here and the dynamics we got btw the doctor and clara was superb - it definitely was a change in pace as compared to previous companions.

To be fair, this isn't exactly the first time since regenerating that's he done that (locking Clara in the room with the killer robots without explanation in the first episode (because he knew she would be able to extract the right bit of information from them, but still), having to do damage control every time he says something a bit horrible to the people around him, the doctor being gleeful at realising that he was correct that there was no such thing as a good dalek (because he was proven right), when the dalek was now slaughtering innocent humans, The Doctor not being straight with her during The Caretaker when her main concern was the safety of the kids, and generally just being a patronising dick to Clara throughout the series). 

Basically, it may have been one incident, but it was the incident to break the straw on the camel's back, so to speak.  I mean if you had to put up with this much shit without much thanks for the time you literally stopped the Doctor being wiped from existence, you'd snap as well regardless of what the Doctor has done for the universe.

ADDENDUM: Basically, this series is showing that the 12th Doctor has the same ""little people"" flaw that the 10th Doctor had, and that despite the 11th's more caring personality, the reality is that he never truly learned from his mistakes in ""The Waters of Mars"". Clara's reason for anger is basically the same as Adelaide's - humanity doesn't want some egomaniac treating humanity like some personal pet project making arbitrary decisions about whether someone should be helped or not...

Yes, I see Clara's annoyance but I've also seen countless episodes before that have dealt with the same moral dilemma - whether the human race should kill something because it's not human. The abortion metaphor seems to give a real sense that pro-life wins even when choice is a factor. Let's choose to ignore the unanimous vote for killing it...not subtle at all really. 

Honestly, I can understand why the Doctor left them. Firstly, he's seen this many times before. Humans choosing to kill over mercy and understanding. The fact that he calls the creatures beautiful then the next thing he hears is some stranger asking him how to kill it. It must be gutwrenching for him to hear this over and over again. There's only so many times he can go through this and honestly I don't blame him for bailing!

I also understand Clara's point of view. This is the second time this new face has left her to save herself, the first being in Deep Breath. I feel like he's doing this for a reason, showing her that she can save herself and is more than capable. But, she's really not liking this, and resents the fact that he keeps treating her like a child. 

I also feel like our new Doctor hasn't had much chance to really shine yet, I'm hoping the next episode will rectify that a little. 

Courtney...ahh we get to her. She seems a little like the Anti-Donna to me. Donna was amazing, but thought she was nothing. Courtney is bland, but wants people to call her amazing. I really don't know what they are doing with her character at all. 

Ahh well, I'll keep watching the series and seeing where they are going. I'll be glad when they announce a new companion though.

false,Gorgash,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Dogs - especially fighter breeds - are inherently dangerous. But even fighter breed puppies will grow into friendly, docile dogs if they're raised the right way and properly trained. The reason fighter breeds are banned is because assholes like to weaponise these dogs and raise them to be violent. Even the way they're bred is cruel.

Of course, even the best raised most docile fighter breed dogs can be dangerous. They're animals - they're unpredictable. They need to be properly supervised and controlled. Kept on leash in public and muzzled if necessary. 

Heck, forget the fighter breeds. Leaving a *legal* breed of dog (especially a big breed) alone in a room with a baby is negligence... even if that dog has never hurt a fly in its life, it could potentially go off at any moment.

I don't think anyone wanted the child to die in this situation. It was simply negligence. Best case scenario, they trusted the dog, it had never harmed anyone before, it was a legal breed and something happened to send it over the edge. Worst case scenario, they were idiots, the dog was an aggressive fighter breed and had a history of violence (in which case they've broken the law by keeping a violent illegal breed in the first place).

Ultimately the dogs are just animals - they can't hold the full blame for these things. We have a responsibility to keep dangerous animals under control and away from children.

the list of what this episode got wrong is astounding:

* characters dying only affects us if we are invested in them so introducing someone and then killing them without giving them any character or personality just wastes screen time, especially when their deaths aren't relevant to the plot (this goes for the rest of the series too)

* having main characters missing for much of the episode can be useful (like in blink) but when its done to (obviously) force a conflict that isn't even resolved in the episode (which clearly had enough time left to cover it) it just feels insulting to our intelligence

* the moon has not been orbiting the earth for 100 million years. it is thought to have been orbiting the earth for around 4.5 billion years(4,500 million)

* the explanation given for the moons increased mass is paper thin (somehow an egg increases in mass without any energy input?)

* are we really going to claim that those things are single cells? because that's just copying bad voyager episodes

* we will not be using space shuttles again in 50 years. I don't care if its meant to be a one-off case we have better options being built now (plus if Mexico had capable craft why not just use one of them?)

* how is it day on earth when the entirety of the land facing the moon in previous shots was dark

* is the 15 year old girl meant to be your target audience? because it seems more like the audience your targeting is about ten years younger then that (this is another character who serves zero purpose except to waste screen time)

&gt; I enjoyed it. The science was all over the place but it always has been in Who. Part of the charm.
I liked the character interactions and there was a tense atmosphere that was well done. The Doctor was being a bit of a bastard but he got called out for that. Iplayer crashed on me just as Clara threatened to slap him so hard he'd regenerate so I have to rewatch to get the sense of the rest of the scene.
Episode managed to have a elements of humour and horror while also having ridiculous science. Although I'd have hoped for a more Lovecraftian cosmic horror feel for an alien hatching out of the moon.
Good female characters as well. Passes the Bechtel test anyway.

That's why it is usually best not to think about the paradoxes the show introduces.

Another way to think about it is an extension of how they handle the fixed point thing.  For the time traveller, time is like Schrodinger's cat, until it is observed by the extra-chronological beings, every moment may or may not have happened. Events only become fixed when they are observed by an outsider. But fixed points are localised, so the only parts that are fixed are the bits the outsider can actually see. When River shoots Matt Smith, it becomes a fixed point, because Amy, Rory and future River observe it. However until the moment became a part of The Doctor's relative present, who that Matt Smith character happened to be was in flux.  The first time we observed The Doctor being shot, it could have actually been the doctor, and then time was rewritten when The Doctor turned out to be the teseract instead. That's also why reading the book was bad even though the book had already been written - until Amy reads that point in the book, the words on the page are in flux.

In a clumsy way, The Doctor does point out this is the case - yes they had been to the moon in the future, but there is no reason to believe it was the moon as we know it (in fact, it turns out it still isn't the moon as we know it), the universe has a way of filling in the gaps and resolving the paradoxes. (hell, if they had blown up the moon, the course of human history would have still led them to expand throughout the universe and endure until the end of time, because we know they did - just maybe the motivation would have been because they realised how fragile the Earth is rather than because they saw life in space).

tl;dr As implied by the name, the TARDIS maintain a concept of a relative present, and the only things that can be confirmed as definitely happening are the things physically observed by the present.",0,1412459486,null,0,1412459701,0,cl0hxqy,t3_2iam06,t1_cl0hxqy,t1_cl0gywu,null,1426683235,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Canteen is reasonably cheap and serves lovely food, I went there today and had a bowl of soup and a chicken leg tagine on a flatbread as big as my head with a seasonal salad, all for £8.95.

Unless you're a vegetarian, go to the Hobgoblin on Gloucester Road (everyone else is recommending it for a reason!). Their burgers are delicious, but my favourite dish is their dirty dirty fries: Chips topped with pulled pork, cheddar and stilton.

1. Remove Courtney, add a second astronaut or maybe Danny but never bring up Courtney again.

2.Have the egg do some kind of damage, it can even cause the doctor to explain that it will fall over the many future years which will make mankind seek safety in the stars and whatever.

3. The spiders were just Urgh. Maybe replace then with direct things from the creature like the tentacles in the beast below but not as 'they're germs'

4. Don't add a randomn replacement moon with no explanation, if you want a moon to return then have the parents of the original egg bringing back a new one and adding more threat to the earth.

5. TELL US what that thing is, give it more depth and character after the events.

6. Get your science right, instead of the moon gaining mass just have it so its shrinking, increasing its surface gravity enough for production ease saying that the creature is pulling in the shell to crack it or some biological stuff.

Aside from that i liked the concept, the setting they made and the idea of a big threat to all mankind or a single innocent life was good (frankly i could see that concept as a full-movie style of thing). And i like the character development of Clara and showing the doctors utter change from his previous more compassionate selves.

false,NotEnoughVideoGames,eccleston,Eccleston,"Ok, I just finished having a rant to myself about this episode. First of all I just want to say that there were three things about the episode that I really liked, Capaldi's performance was great, The Doctor's speach about killing Hitler is something that I actually appreciated, and I liked the idea at least of a companion really standing up to the Doctor over some of the bullshit he pulls. 

But that aside, the whole thing was just a complete jumble. None of the idea's seemed well thought out, and it honestly felt as though it was either a first draft, or possibly two or more stories just thrown together. Which is actually a surprise since apparently this was written some time back for 11, so I'm guessing that the script wasn't considered good enough to run back then and was given a hasty re-write for 12.

Of the things that I found most frustrating, the first was the Doctor jumping into the pit after finding amniotic fluid. There was a lot of bad science in the episode, but anyone with even a passing understanding of biology will know that an egg chamber will be the most heavily defended part of a nest. Jumping in after finding a massive pit full of spiders was just idiotic. Just in regards to the science, either go hard or go home, don't use a cherry picked bunch of sciencey sounding stuff and just throw it in wherever. 

But more than that, the Doctor's reasoning in abandoning Clara was just ridiculous. Ok, he won't meddle in human only afairs, so what does a giant alien egg causing natural disasters and potentially raining debris on the planet have to do with human affairs. It's no different than any other alien threat, other than it's older. By that logic he shouldn't have stopped the Racnoss, or the Silence.

You really think bond yields would not have increased. Could I ask what your basing this decision on, becuase historically, even outside of a recession, governments falling tends to increase bond yields. 

Furthermore, what is your assessment of our relatively descent status as a save haven for capital the last 4 years, compared to this 'what if scenario'. The necessary policy uncertainty that comes with governments falling makes investment look extremely unattractive.

Interesting, go on.

&gt;I don't dislike Clegg for what he did, if he were the leader of the bigger party things would have been very different. People will dislike Clegg for allowing the attack on the poor despite having the countries best interests at heart because they don't understand that he did have their best interests at heart.

I think he's actually going to be remembered by history as one of the tragic casualties of British politics. he's a descent capable statesman, nothing amazingly inspiring sure. But he's allowed himself to be nailed to the cross for the good of the country.

But I think people are getting one thing *very* wrong. The fact the Liberal democrats have not eaten their leader for the first time in nearly 2 decades when the public got mad, is a significant development in the maturity of the party.

Ultimately, yes next election won't be pretty, but lib dems will likely be in goverment again anyway, becuase lol FPTP (prehaps one of histories great ironies). The party is properly transitioning from protest party, to serious centrist party of goverment every few elections.

This isn't a formality either.   The law deems that the player is better than other possible English players, and international caps is usually a key marker (a certain percentage of appearances within the last 40 internationals or something).   He doesn't qualify under this.

Low bond yields despite a massive deficit after saving our banks and having a massive debt increase. We have loan bond yields because of the bank of england being able to print money as pay our debts as a lender of last resort so people don't worry when buying UK bonds.

Also having control of our interest rate means we could keep the interest rates low to keep credit available and make sure people had more free income through lower mortgage payments for those on variable interest rates thus increasing spending. How do you think we kept cutting our deficit whilst not doing a Greece?

Then there's the quantitative easing which means the bank of england buys up assets of banks causing them to stabilise and allowing for them to lend up more credit as well... the so called 'trickle down effect'.

false,FireKnightV,jack,Jack Harkness,"This episode was the biggest jetstream of bullshit to come out of the science fiction genre in years.

I said it before and I'll say it again. If this show is going to venture into the darker side of the moral spectrum, then you need a very strong writing team behind the camera that can recognize a complex issue when it comes up. In universe, Earth needs its own XCOM project to counter the ideas of the Doctor and get Earth ready for venturing into space. 

The writing team has failed in each episode that demonstrated moral ambiguity, such as when Ten fought the Sycorax. In that case, Torchwood was absolutely right in blowing up that ship especially when you consider that the leader tried to stab the Doctor in the back.

In this case, Clara was completely and utterly wrong because the writer had to smack people over the head with an abortion metaphor, which isn't even equivalent to this episode's plot in terms of severity. The rocks of the Moon could have caused an extinction event if they were thrown to Earth. The monster could have turned and attacked the planet and brought all those spiders that are somehow also single celled organisms with it. And of course, the girl had to be there for some reason and Clara had to whine about feeling the weight of the universe on her shoulders before giving the Doctor the fuck off.

Again, this team needs to think XCOM and Moffat needs to hire writers that can match that if it is going to go down this road.",0,1412462487,null,0,false,0,cl0j6hf,t3_2iazo2,t1_cl0j6hf,t3_2iazo2,null,1426682656,25,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,25

You have an active military force killing civilians on a daily basis, that needs to stop.

Realistically the only way to stop this ongoing murder is to either remove the murderers or remove the entire civilian population.

Either one would require ground troops in the hundreds of thousands.

I'm all for negotiation but when people are actively killing people the time to talk is over it's too late, negotiations have failed, it becomes time to act. Human rights are a big talking point at the minute, peoples right to life the most important right is being taken away on a daily basis.

The only payment 'scheme' in this sport is sponsors (companies who want you to advertise for them) and they're pretty hard to come by now that there is so much talent.

When they are too small you don't really get many posts or discussion as there aren't enough people on at once (unless there are particular events that force a lot of people to be on at the same time, e.g. sports or TV shows). So comments like ours replying to each other wouldn't really happen in the space of an hour or so.

When they are very large, you get fewer larger stories as there is a steady stream of people that want to comment (and upvote) on an issue, this is why you get large stories hanging around for a few days, as there are always people around to keep a particular topic going.

I think /r/unitedkingdom is just about the right size now and if more people start to use this particular subreddit you would eventually get to the same situation, where the large topics would hang around and small things would be drowned out.

2) It's weird. I've never really worked anywhere that did the beer after work thing. For special occasions sometimes, sure. Generally though I don't go. Work is work for me, and social is social. I try to keep them separate as possible. 

3) Beer after Gym? Never heard of that, but it's fair enough. Men particularly won't generally be in the gym to waste calories. They'll be trying to gain muscle and extra calories are fine when that's your goal. 

4) That's absolutely hilarious, and very Del Boy of us. 

5) Ice cubes in wine? Never seen it. I'd look at someone weird if they did that. 

6) Okay.

7) I can't remember the last time I didn't have a hell of a time at a funeral. One of my friends committed suicide last year and her wake was seriously the best night out of the year. 150 odd people went. Shame she had to miss it! She'd have been all over it. I didn't realise that this wasn't how most of Europe does it. I'd be interested to know which countries do and don't drink heavily at wakes. 

8) Still never done a pub crawl. Sad times. 

9) Can't argue that. But we still need to *think* we have a reason, otherwise we get a kind of sad realisation situation going on. And sad realisations are a reason to drink.

These things could be true in theory, but Rodgers hasn't yet done these things and Lovren hasn't adjusted to our team like he did Southampton, where they definitely did play a very high line and his aggressive style paid dividends. 

I know it's early but it seems like the Pochettino system brought the best out of him (people thought this of Lallana, but he is a great technical player who could fit at most clubs). We are still defending fairly deep and Lovren looks unsure in the box, which is where Skrtel seems to be our most confident defender crazily. I still think he is a very good defender, but he doesn't look like the solution we were looking for. 

Again it is early and we have 3 new players in our back 4, and we could sign Valdes which would allow us to play a higher line, but so far it seems that we did overpay on him. £20m is a lot for a center back, which appeared okay because he was supposed to fit in and whatever but it doesn't seem that way yet.",0,1412466862,null,0,false,0,cl0l0gt,t3_2ibdlp,t1_cl0l0gt,t3_2ibdlp,null,1426681800,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

They only had the bit of info she gave them.  They were in no real position to decide.  Also she would still be alive in 2049, so that creates an interesting situation.

&gt;How convenient that the creature managed to lay an egg bigger than itself offscreen and as soon as it hatches.

Actually they took care of that.  The moon was smaller.  When they went back and she looks at it, it is much bigger.

We have to assume it was taking in energy from the sun to create mass.  I'd say the bigger question is why did it look like a winged creature.  A space creature that can move in space would need to do some kind of manipulation of space/time like the tardis to move.  Wings would make no sense.

**The Doctor** - I get the idea of the Doctor refusing to make the decision. I get the idea that this is humanity's future and humanity needs to be the one to make the choice about what that future not only will be, but what it means for them as a whole. But flat out **leaving**? This is the polar opposite of *The Waters of Mars*, and perhaps that's the point, but Jesus, putting Clara (to say nothing of Courtney) in that kind of danger, just as a test? The Doctor is dark, the Doctor's not a goddamn psychopath.

**The Moon** - It's an egg. 'kay. I can go there. The moon is an egg, it's got a being inside it, and when it hatches, the moonegg will explode. I'm there with you. Annnnnnnnd a new.. moon-sized egg will be immediately laid? Same size? That... no, that's not how most biology works, other than shouting ""but it's a SPACE egg!""

**Clara** - Nice to see her really, rightly upset with the Doctor. The feeling, I got though, was that his departure was ONLY meant to cause this reaction, in terms of framing the story. An idiotic mis-characterization of him, passed off as him making a point, when really, the writers just wanted to show Clara setting boundaries with him.

false,Cyridius,irish,Ireland,"It's a system of unsustainable growth; For Capitalism to work, it must keep growing. It's all about profit. But to grow we have to use more and more resources, and it's causing horrible and unsustainable amounts of enviornmental damage, and nothing serious is being done about it because it would inhibit growth.

Secondly, it's a system of inherent inequality. In Capitalism, if I am a worker and I produce something with the value of 10,000£ in one day, I get paid 1,000£ because the business owner needs to get a profit from my employment. In reality, if myself and all the workers decided that we didn't need the business owners and we managed things ourselves, I could get all of that 10,000£ that *I* produced. Surely people should get the fruits of their labour? Of course, within a Communist society as Marx envisioned it, labour would no longer be a commodity to be bought and sold like I'm discussing here, it would be an action done for the common good to exercise your human existence.

Thirdly, I think it's fundamentally at odds with democracy. Let's take a look at the Corporate model; It's the perfect example of tyranny - and I use that word quite literally. Me as a worker performing labour, has no say in what goes on in the industry. The big decision makers in business are the CEO/Board of Directors, and all the major shareholders. The choices; Who produces what, how is it produced, where is it produced, and what is done with the product - all these are done by a very select privileged few, not the people these choices are actually effecting.

What I think this does is create a disconnect from the effects of a decision and the person making it, so horrible things such as enviornmental costs, mass disenfranchisement, and stepping on the rights and lives of other people, don't really come into their decision making process because it's all ""over there"". That, and seeing as Capitalism is all about growth, it will do what it can at all costs to keep growing.

Like, our ancestors fought long and hard to preserve democracy in the political sphere; Why not fight to do so when it comes to the place where we're going to spend most of our lives? That place being the workplace. 

Now, you can agree or disagree with me that the answer to these problems lies with Communism etc. - and don't get me wrong, Communism is not a set, single thing, there's *huge* variety within the Marxist and Anarchist schools of thought - but you have to acknowledge that these things are issues that need to be addressed. 

Personally I think the direction we're all going is that of State Capitalism, in which business and industry is no longer separable from politics, and the distinction between that and things like Fascism are really just a matter of how authoritarian the state is willing to become(And I think we know the answer to that one).

Pressing all over the pitch yields great attacking results, but leaves players out of position when it fails, and this then forces the center backs to make a tackle,cut out a pass, win a header, etc.  If they make a mistake, it's a great scoring opportunity for the other team; hence all the individual mistakes last season.  Look at Chelsea, they can sit back with 11 men behind the ball and completely shut the game down; having 11 men behind the ball is when we look most vulnerable. 

I think it is a ridiculously demanding system for the center backs, as they cannot rely on the positioning of the midfield.  When the other team has possession, Lovren has to be wondering whether Gerrard/Hendo/whoever is going to drop off or press; if he guesses incorrectly, he ends up out of position.  This creates uncertainty, which leads to mistakes, leads to goals, leads to him playing poorly, leads to us having this conversation.

The Lib Dems are internationalists who believe in holding governments to account through collaborative international conventions and treaties - hence their support for the EU and the ECHR. The Conservatives believe that the British parliament must have the total and final say on anything concerning the UK and anything (like the EU or ECHR) which purports to take away the total sovereignty of parliament must be stopped in their view. The Conservatives view is the traditionally correct constitutional view but it's probably changed without anyone really noticing since we joined the EU which is partly why UKIP is angry. But as a result of that view the Tories end up on the side of authoritarian centralised national government and tend to be against anything that would bind Westminster. 

If you want a run down on the ECHR and the HRA I would definitely recommend reading (**PDF**) [this short introduction](https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/human-rights/human-rights-making-sense-human-rights.pdf) written by Tony Blair's government for public officials explaining very simply what the whole thing is about.

&gt; But more than that, the Doctor's reasoning in abandoning Clara was just ridiculous. Ok, he won't meddle in human only afairs, so what does a giant alien egg causing natural disasters and potentially raining debris on the planet have to do with human affairs. It's no different than any other alien threat, other than it's older. By that logic he shouldn't have stopped the Racnoss, or the Silence. 

I can *kinda* see how this makes sense. The Doctor probably knew that, even if there were massive side effects for Earth, they would've been relatively okay in both outcomes. So he decides to see which they would choose: Good or bad. And yes, this episode clearly picks which one is ""good"" and which is ""bad"".

You may note that what is sold in the colonies is in fact ""Twinings of London"", not simply ""Twinings"". While it is indeed produced by the same company, the quality of the colonial brand is much lower (but see note below). It is, of course, possible to have actual Twinings shipped to the colonies, the cost of doing so will be several times that of the tea itself!

Instead, I would advise seeking British teas. If they are not available where you are visiting, or if their cost is too high, most health food stores offer loose-leaf tea in their bulk bins, and it is generally of acceptable quality. Many Barnes and Noble bookstores offer Harney &amp; Sons tea, which is also acceptable. If you like flavoured teas, you may be able to find Adagio, but in most cases it will have to be shipped (but, since it's shipped from within the colonies, it's still cheaper than Twinings).

Note on ""Twinings of London"" tea: the Twinings of London Earl Grey is extremely weak. While this is, obviously, normally a bad thing, it does mean that if you forget to remove the tea leaves it won't oversteep.

The Houses of Parliament make laws in which the Judiciary (of which the Supreme Court is a part) interprets those laws.

When someone calls the government to account saying that legislation they pass isn't compatible with the convention, then go up the British courts and hope they agree with them. However, sometimes someone takes a case to the court ""Nope, what the Government has done is compatible with the convention"" and then they take it to Strasbourg and the European Judges say ""This person is right, what the UK Parliament has done is incompatible!"". Our own courts are ignored in favour of the European ones. 

In actual fact, because Parliament is sovereign in this country, Parliament can just do what they want with a majority in favour but Parliament still cares because it doesn't shine a good light on them.

...

And that's it. I don't think the UK has many John Oliver type shows, because they'd be reported by OFCOM (media watchdog) too much and be pulled off air. 

They're the only ones I can think of. I believe Ross' show has been off air for a while, and Adam Hills' Last Leg is on series break. 

Alan Carr's Chatty Man is very camp, but interesting. It has a lot of booze. 

Graham Norton - very camp, but very interesting and funny.

I liked the beauty that the doctor saw in something that could destroy an entire species.  They're small fry in his big universe.  I liked the bratty kid who was inspired by the events in the end.. she saw something that most of us will never get to see because we will die long before anything more than mundane happens.. and it potentially makes her want something more. I liked that despite humanity being inherently fearful of the unknown, two people chose to believe in something other than fear.. propelling humanity into the stars.

You sound self-righteous as if he's somehow committed an unthinkable social crime. He chose a few select policies that he knew the Tories would be broadly OK with saving the rest up for 2015 and in return he agreed to support a selection of Tory policies. In fact politicians give up their principles all the time for practicality and if they don't do it they should be ridiculed. If an idea will not work and yet the party keeps pushing it they should be criticised. Isn't that what this subreddit has been saying the Tories should have done over austerity? Why is it encouraged for the Tories to abandon their principles when it's policies we don't think are working but somehow unforgivable when the Lib Dems give up on parts of their manifesto because they know it has not chance of being accepted by the Tories as shared policy? 

Austerity is a Cameron/Tory principle so by this logic the Tories deserve massive credit in equal volume to Clegg's excoriation for sticking to their word and ideology by pushing through the 'bedroom tax'. By that logic it shows principle and regardless of reality or common sense they are quite right to stick with it even if it hurts people. I don't think many Clegg critics would go along with that and would rather that the Tories abandon the policy (and principle) now it has been demonstrated that in most places social tenants have nowhere to go. By this logic I commend UKIP for sticking to their jingoistic policies despite the fact that economic fact means their manifesto will seriously harm us all or commend the BNP for continuing to hate immigrants for superficial reasons despite making no attempts to understand them and human beings.

And if you think people dislike Moffat, wait until you hear some of the stuff people say about John Nathan-Turner. I think one of the major reasons people dislike Moffat as a showrunner (even if they like him as a writer) is because of his series arcs. For the first time since Trial of a Time Lord, Moffat created long term ever present mysteries for each series. People like the initial mystery and the excitement it brings, but most people find that his resolutions never match the highs of the initial mystery. Others find his solutions too convoluted or too rushed at the end. Moffat even took his mythos a step further than Trial of a Time Lord stretching some of the mysteries across Matt Smith's three seasons. Some people were just tired of all the teases and misdirection.There are other reasons but I think the above is true for many of his detractors, at least the ones that I have talked to in person and online.",0,1412475304,null,0,false,0,cl0ofs7,t3_2ibocf,t1_cl0ofs7,t3_2ibocf,null,1426680142,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

For all we know the creature could have immediately consumed the earth. The doctor says creatures don't normally destroy their nests, But at the same time creatures can sometimes be laid within reach of their nearest needs.

A nest is created as an opportune place to grow, the earth could have been a food source for the creature, it literally could have been a planet eater.

----

They mention the high tides on earth a lot. But they also indicate that the situation was occuring 10 years after the mexican's excavation site when all the issues occurred. So as shitty as it might have been on earth at the time. Humanity had survived at least 10 years. Would we have propsered as we would have before, maybe not. But we seem to have a good deal of the power network intact, so it's questionable what the future really held for earth.

---

The message was further pushed by the fact that it had a female only cast. Likely to stop it becoming a more direct anti-abortion argument. With the only male character basically going ""Welp I'm out"" because as much as a guy may try to direct a partner with regards to whether or not to abort their child it is still at the end of the day the choice of the mother.

----

And it ended with a ""What a beautiful Miracle"". If it had gone through the whole episode and then ended with a terrible monster emerging. It might have shattered an anti-abortion message prior to that with the implication that not everything is a wonderous miracle. That just because you have the potential to have a child doesn't mean it's going to be a great thing. 

Except the show literally states that by not aborting the moon, Humanity evolved as a species stopped shooting each other and started growing up and expanding outward into the universe.

Basically that my having a moon baby that humanity didn't want they become upstanding citizens of the universe at large. They may make missteps as we see throughout the series. But apparently this was the catalysyt agent

When humanity was polled, they voted to blow the moon up.

The only reason the moon *didn't* get blown up was because of Clara and Courtney, who were only there because the Doctor brought them there... and more importantly, *left them there*. 

He could have said ""This is none of our business, we shouldn't interfere, everyone back in the TARDIS"" as he did with Donna at Pompeii. Instead, he left Clara and a fifteen-year-old girl behind and forced them to participate in this hideous decision. 

He *didn't* let humanity make its own decision. He interfered by leaving Clara and Courtney there. He interfered by whisking them all off to see the moon hatch before Lundvik could restart the bomb countdown.

We're told at the end that seeing the beautiful dragon hatch out of the moon inspired humanity's development. That end result would still have happened without him putting Clara in the agonizing position.

If he'd told Clara that the creature could hatch without destroying Earth, her decision would have been easy, and humanity would have been just as inspired to develop.

Instead, he withholds information and turns it into a test for Clara -- with the future of humanity at stake. It's cold as hell, and I can't blame her at all for calling him out on it.",0,1412478049,null,0,false,0,cl0pjwl,t3_2iax5q,t1_cl0pjwl,t1_cl0p556,null,1426679622,9,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,9

The term you were looking for is Pro-Choice. And even then, If the argument can be made that killing the fetus while still inside the mothers womb would save the mother from dying. You will most certainly find people who will be pro-abortion in that circumstance.

If you were given the choice, your wife is about to give birth. Doing so will kill her. We can save her or we can save the child. But not both. 100% fatality either way. Then you can argue that either way if you don't have a stance of anti-abortion.

Save the mother, Try again(or adopt). Save the baby, Mother dies.

When you have an egg now it's full of yolk, by the time the thing hatches it's full of chicken. The yolk(Minerals) was converted into the creature.

But, moving on. I'm sorry, but whatever you said about the birth killing the mother? It has zero bearing on the episode. The abortion angle was never handled at all. 

Clara and co. were never asking wether it was morally acceptable to abort  a fetus. They always said *baby*. Because it was a baby, that was pretty clear - even more so because it was born from an egg, not straight from his mother. So the thing that separated it from the outside world was the egg's shell - that's it. They were never performing an abortion, they were killing a baby that was ready to live autonomously on the outside world. *Actively* killing a baby, not passively allowing it to die so the mother cold live. 

Also, the fact that it turns out ok in the end... I'm not sure how that adds anything to the abortion angle at all. 

And about the bit of men not making decisions: 1) That was not the point - the Doctor was the only non-human present, not the only man; and 2) ... yes? It's a woman's body, after all. It *is* her choice.

Apollo 34 was launched in 2056 to create the first long term human mission on mars. It landed in 2058 when it founded bowie base one. And it was destroyed in 2059.

Now the story we see plays out in 2049. And at the end of the episode the doctor says in the middle of the 21st century humanity started to spread it's wings.

So while there is only 7 years between the events of this episode and that of Waters of Mars. It could simply be argued that there was a rapid uptake in space tech post 2049. Which is I supposed the first evidence of a greater universe to explore(Though how many times have they been invaded at this point)

They already have the capability to establish a lunar base in 2049. So it's not outside the realm of possibility to do so in 2059.

---

It could even be argued that it's why the doctor bugs out. Following Waters of Mars(where he tried to recuse himself from the situation) he knows how important these early space missions are to humanity reaching the stars. And he wanted them to make the decision.

And that by forcing Clara to make the decision he wouldn't have to deal with the negative effects that he experienced post Water of Mars.

The Doctor swings his 1.5 meter-long yo-yo and it gets soaked in Amniotic Fluid, yet we see no fluid whatsoever from a different viewpoint? And how the hell can he tell immediately? And how is the Amniotic Fluid staying on the surface of the moon if there's vacuum right above it?
The Mexican spacelab floods with oxygen in 2.5 seconds? Okay ya sure let's go with that.

The moon should NOT look that big in ANY instances where it was viewed from Earth (on the beach or from Clara's window). About the size of the moon when Bruce pulls it closer in Bruce Almighty...

I was talking with a friend about it later, and she's not very happy with the entirety of the season so far. She keeps getting a sense of being disappointed due to a lack of what the episode can offer, as if it builds up a hype but ultimately lets you down. For example, they could have shown the alien a little...like come on. She's also disappointed with the lack of explanation from the Doctor, like in previous episodes (think Timey Wimey explanations and Space-Curving-Blanket stuff). I'm tending to agree with her, like there could be SO much more science in this science-fiction show. It's slowly becoming drama....

Another thing I'm noticing with this season is that most if not all episodes so far have been on Earth. You have a guy who can travel the universe, yet he seems glued to an Earth for which, he feels, he has no opinion in making decisions in its future. Where are all the alien species you keep telling me that with which humans come in contact and with which humans live harmoniously?? :(

false,KoNP,silence,Silence,"Once again I find myself on the outside of the ""majority"" opinion (read: opinion of this subreddit).

I enjoyed the episode, immensely. Sure, the A-plot was a bit goofy, but shit, the show's been guilty of goofy plots since day 1. I really, really liked the Doctor *finally* getting a telling-off (although I don't think he really deserved it, but he did need to realise that sometimes he can be an ass even when he's trying to help) and I loved the fact that he stuck by his guns as far as the ""not making the decision for you"" thing.

I agree with the ""taking the stabilisers off"" attitude but I think he could have handled it a lot more tactfully - however, that was the entire point of the episode, so I'm glad he DIDN'T handle it tactfully. He was legitimately trying to help - but this Doctor is very very far from being human; he's one of the most 'alien' incarnations to date, especially in the new series. He's much more of a Time Lord (arrogant, patronising, smug) than his previous regenerations but he's obviously struggling with this as well - trying to make something good out of it.

I spotted the whole pro-life vs pro-choice argument, but I disagree that it was ""heavy handed"". In fact I think it was presented fairly evenly. Both sides had good points and I took away from it that the only person who is properly equipped to make that kind of decision is the person involved. The whole ""ignoring the Earth"" thing, for me, was a metaphor for not letting other people make your decisions for you.

Getting back to my first statement (about being on the outside)... I'm starting to feel like I don't belong in this subreddit anymore, and I'm starting to think I shouldn't call myself a ""fan"" of this show. It's not that I don't enjoy it - quite the opposite, I've loved the show since ""The Unearthly Child"".

Look at series five, his first season as show runner, his episodes were the best among them, ""The Eleventh Hour"" was the best introduction to a Doctor we've ever had in my opinion. And ""The Beast Below"" was an amazing follow up, even if a lot of people disagree with me, it has a few flaws but the overall moral, and result of that episode were great, plus it doesn't link at all to the series finale. ""The Time of Angels"" and ""Flesh and Stone"" were both great too, having a real sense of threat and a great ending. 

In Season six a few of his episodes (A Good Man Goes to War"" and ""Let's Kill Hitler"" were tied to the main series plotline, but still felt like their own episode, ""Let's Kill Hitler"" was pretty much its own episode anyway and was one of the best of that season imo. 

Season seven had Moffat's writing drop a bit, but his episodes were still the best of the season, ""Asylum of the Daleks"" being the best of part one by far, seeing as the others were crap except for ""The Angels Take Manhattan"", which was also coincidentally written by Moffat. Part two only had two episodes written by him, and ""The Bells of Saint John"" is my favourite of the lot, although I DID feel ""The Name of the Doctor"" was a bit of a letdown in the end, it did make for a good lead in to the 50th.

So far, season eight seems to be pretty average in comparison so far, I've only really enjoyed ""Listen"" and Time Heist"" so far, but I feel that ""Deep Breath"" is a close third, doing a good job introducing Peter Capaldi, and having good pacing, but not much else.

Technically speaking the doctor shouldn't be there. Neither should clara. The decisions they make should have been ones of natural order.

Now when he's stopping a nefarious plot, or something gone wrong then his additional knowledge is integral.

When it comes to something natural that if it weren't for them being in the wrong place at the wrong time(Or the TARDIS taking him where he needs to be). That all his information shouldn't be impacting the decision.

The information he gives clara about not destroying nests(Which is bullshit, because if the creature ate planets, it's nest was the solar system and Earth a food Source).

You'd be far more likely to argue that the creature deserved the chance to live. The point wasn't to provide a solution but the fact that humanity had to make a decision. Maybe it would be the right one or the wrong one, or maybe someone else would make it for them. But he wasn't doing it from a place of pure logic. He wanted it done from a place of emotion. Clara and courtney being the only ones not having experienced shitty earth, were the only people capable of making the decision clara made. The idea that earth, said kill it and it didn't kill it and everything was hunky dory, could instill the idea that maybe killing shit shouldn't be the first response.

It could also be argued that the Doctor recused himself in the same way that Waters of Mars bit him in the arse. That regardless of Clara's decision time would find a way to correct itself. Because even with taking adelaide back to earth. Her killing herself and the story being known still lead to a successful granddaughter.

It may have changed smaller things like what century humans left earth, but would probably end the same.

false,JB_UK,null,null,"Yes, paradoxically, a lot of things do not get more affordable as the population gets more wealthy. For instance, in a housing market like ours, where demand outstrips supply, and supply is heavily constrained, if you double wages, it's very likely that house prices will double (at least, approximately). But if the increases in income are shared out unequally, people who are doing less will have wages that rise more slowly than the cost of housing, which means they get squeezed out of more in demand areas. That, in turn, has effects on the life chances for their children, because house prices are linked with employment opportunities, quality of schools, and even access to green space and levels of pollution.

Doctors wages are another example of something that rises as general incomes go up. In practice, doctors wages will always be top 10% or 5%, and they will increase to stick with that level, because we want to attract highly motivated, educated, intelligent people to go into the job. But, because of that, access to a doctor never gets cheaper, no matter how much the prosperity of the population goes up. If I earn £1 an hour, and the doctor £10, I have to work ten hours to be able to buy one hour of the doctor's time, if I earn £10, and the doctor £100, the situation has not changed. And, again, if increases in average wage are driven principally by wage increases for the top 20%, the doctor becomes more unaffordable for someone who earns a lower wage, even if their income has significantly increased. It's lucky we have the NHS, but the same applies to private physios, dentists, therapists, etc (i.e. where NHS services can be patchy).",0,1412480813,null,0,1412481343,0,cl0qo4k,t3_2ib9w2,t1_cl0qo4k,t1_cl0l8z7,null,1426679101,39,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,39

Benefits are supposed to be a safety net for the poor, not a top-up for the rich.

Disability payments are not means tested, yet there are far more claimants than for JSA. Figures at the end of 2012 put people claiming some form of DLA at **11.6million people**.

If people claiming JSA can't get anything off the government if they have more than £16,000 in the bank, why can other benefits?

The standard argument I always hear is ""Disabled people shouldn't have to use their savings to get by"". If that's the case, why do unemployed people?

If you're working and earning £40,000 a year, with around £20,000 in savings and suddenly become unemployed, you don't get any help from the government. You're not entitled to any benefits of any sort because ""benefits are for the poor"".

Yet that goes completely out the window if you're disabled. You can still keep you job and claim disability regardless of your actual need for the money. [You can win the lottery and still claim disability.](http://www.theguardian.com/society/blog/2012/feb/13/lottery-winner-benefits-not-feel-right)

The other argument is ""Well they're entitled to it"". So was Jimmy Carr to use loopholes to avoid tax, doesn't make it any less scummy.

And this is by no means an attack on disabled people. This is aimed at the government itself who should be doing more about this, but have only just started to pull their finger out.

And I bet I'll still get people saying ""Well they **are** entitled to the money"". And again I'll say; ""maybe you should remember that next time you moan about someone claiming their pittance of JSA instead of complaining about benefit scroungers"".

We waste billions in this country giving benefit money to people who don't need it, and then blame the unemployed because they're an easy target. And we hide it behind the mindset of ""don't you dare attack the disabled and pensioners"".

The amount of flak he's received recently has been IMO very undeserved. I think he was right to put Lambert up top. At least he tried to make runs in behind which stretched their defense...something Balotelli did NOT do in the previous games. It's likely Brendan gave Mario these instructions against Basel but at the end of the day Balotelli's gonna play like Balotelli, which is not always a bad thing, but perhaps it's not suited to our play style in a 4-3-3 (not bad in a 4-4-2 diamond with Studge making the runs though as seen in the spurs away game!). 

As the striker, making those runs and stretching the defense is *vital* in our system as it gives our midfield much more room to operate. We can press better and also have more time on the ball. Also Gerrard is much less exposed -it's not his role to break up the play anyway. 

...how about the imagination to put Lucas in the pivot and send Gerrard forward at the end? Flippin' brilliant if you ask me. It's probably not something he can do the whole game, but if he spends most of the game deep then he can definitely cameo up top. Also it gives Lucas (or Can) some minutes.

bullshit lmao. Lallana was easily second best on pitch and not far behind Henderson. It was a decent performance by him, nothing more or less.

&gt;when healthy, Johnson is simply one of the best fullbacks in the Premier League.

What you really meant to say is ""on his day"", which is unfortunate because that isn't the same thing as ""when healthy"". I think he was awful for long periods last season, but much of the criticism he received was over the top and down right cruel to someone that has done well for us for a decent amount of time. But regardless of what he had done for us, he was mediocre, he switched off so frequently and consistently lost possession while moving forward doing the same thing over and over.

&gt;I cannot tell you how frustrated I was by Manquillo repeatedly pumping in crosses from 20-30 yards out in the hope that Lambert would somehow get on the end of it; he's been doing it for weeks, mind you, and it's completely antithetical to the quick, crisp, on-the-carpet build-up play that's brought us so much success.

We don't have Suarez anymore. Or Sturridge for the moment, we can't play like we did last season, especially when they have already crowded the box, even with Suarez we struggled against this. As long as crosses are not the only thing he is doing every time its ok, there were a few occasions where he would pass it off, and if that player couldn't see anything better it would go back to him to send in a cross. 

&gt;Hard to believe, I know, but Glen Johnson's been England's right back for the past 4-5 years for a reason. He's an exceptional footballer, particularly in the middle third, and is critical to the build-up play that keeps our offense moving. 

He has been england's right back because England have no one else..kyle walker is practically a sprinter, who else is there? I mean sure, Johnson WAS really good just 2 seasons ago, in 12/13 I loved watching Enrique and Johnson push up and Gerrard could always pick one of them out, Enrique connected really well with Coutinho/Sturridge and Johnson was actually a little threatening then as well. The problem was last season where he was awful going forward, constantly taking on his man and losing the ball, and defensively he would switch off. He would let players get into space, and on set pieces he would let his man run free and win headers basically uncontested. 

I'd love to see johnson get back and put in decent performances and it does annoy me when people constantly slag him off after his service to the club, but you do need to look at his performance last season objectively and not get carried away by a 30 minute spell against WBA ",0,1412481792,null,0,false,0,cl0r1f2,t3_2ibxhx,t1_cl0r1f2,t3_2ibxhx,null,1426678929,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

1)  Spiders as just unicelluar germs...giving only half the earth the chance to vote since let's face it, the other half is probably asleep.  

2)  The argument between the Doctor and Clara.  It's weird because I feel like neither side was really shown to develop here...which is disappointing because it could have served as the culminating build-up between the Doctor and Clara.  

I wish Clara, being the impossible girl, would have brought up past exploits of the Doctor clearly interfering or trying to to point how different he is and how much she does not know him anymore.  I wish she would have brought up that though it might not have been humanity's choice, it wasn't her's or Courtney's  (a child to make) since it wasn't their time.  Heck, bring up how the Doctor is making soldiers out of her and Courtney.  And as for forcing her to choose a decision that could affect billions of people...the Doctor would know about that. 

As for the Doctor, I do think that some part of this whole making the companions choose make sense.  But for some reason, the whole way he chose to go about this whole scenario didn't sit right.  Anyone else fit this way?

I like hearing the ideas from several people on this website.  So here's my questions.

I laud when Doctor Who attempts some realism but at the end of the day it is a show about an alien time-traveler who has been to different universes and dimensions, seen the universe destroyed and reborn, and has been to the big bang which itself only possible because a ship from the universe itself went back in time and blew up. Right now we cannot really explain any of that with modern science. And to be fair Doctor Who has never pretended to be a hard science series.

 Yes some things will be unbelievable and sometimes they may frustrate my own sense of the laws of physics, but I don't think I will ever really let that ruin my own experience of the show. Yes the Moon stuff was ridiculous and yes there should have been more consequences for it blowing up and being replaced but this is a 45 minute long show. 

 People are already complaining that the episodes are not as pacey as the used to be (which is actually because the showrunner responded to criticism that the characters needed to be more fleshed out so he has had his writers set up more intimate character moments and dialogue) so removing even more of the action scenes involving the Doctor and his companions so they can show some tidal waves or earthquakes or watching some talking heads on a news program talk about the devastation is not really gonna please anyone.

1. I think people get too bogged down in one interpretation of a story even if there are obviously other interpretations readily available. People say that this is an obvious anti-abortion story which bothers them. I understand why they interpret the story that way but I think that is more of a version of the age old Star Trek paradigm the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one. But as we all know from Kirk and crew sometimes the needs of the one outweigh the needs of the few. 

 The episode is about believing that there is good and beauty at the universe and sometimes you have to take risks to see that beauty. It is about people learning that being afraid of an outcome and being justified in that fear does not make their decision the right decision.  It is a lesson that even a complete majority opinion can be wrong.

1. People seem to be mad at Clara for getting mad at the Doctor but if the Prime Minister/President called you in to decide whether or not to launch a nuclear missile and just left you to that decision, I am pretty sure you would be pretty damn angry and confused and frustrated. If he/she came back and patted you on the back and said you made the right choice, you would probably blow up in his/her face.

 Other people are upset that the Doctor left them to make the decision on their own when he has made the same kind of decision over and over. People seem to forget though that the Doctor has nearly destroyed himself from inner turmoil having had to make that kind of decision again and again. He wants to know if he can trust someone else to make this kind of decision (specifically if Clara can). He wants to know if he can truly share the burden of the life he has chosen or if it is too much for his companions. He was happy and overjoyed that Clara made the right choice because he believes that he can share the burden but instead comes off as patronizing. He actually seems like he is trying to let Clara see more of his true self and his inner turmoil by letting her make one of these decisions so she can empathize/sympathize. 

 He also obviously listened to Danny's criticism that he is an officer that leads Clara into battle and she does whatever he says unquestioningly. So here he let Clara make the choice on her own. This time he didn't order her to do anything.

1. Also can humanity ever really step out of his shadow if they never make these decisions for themselves. Humanity up until that point never really had to face too many of these kinds of their decisions on their own. The Doctor has largely made these decisions for them. He wanted to give humanity a chance to decide their own fate. He knows now more than ever that he cannot always be there to save the Earth. Humans have to really start to learn about the universe on their own. He needs to know that humanity will be fine on their own one day (I think he is finally heeding the warnings of Harriet Jones, former Prime Minister). I think he even sheds light on this when he says he doesn't really know how many more times he can/will regenerate.

false,jettloe,null,null,"I think it was superb on every level - this season/series of Doctor Who is everything I’d hoped the restart in 2005 would be. In no particular order:

* The production design of this episode and the season so far has been fantastic, notice the brilliant design of the moon-suits, (non-orange ones), that indicated heaviness and bulk yet moved well; the production design is more sophisticated - oriented toward a more mature audience, (notice the great design of the guards uniforms in TIME HEIST for instance); compare the production design in this season to earlier seasons - earlier seasons are clearly geared more towards a ‘child friendly audience.

* The cinematography: again more sophisticated; great use of graduation of colors, etc.

* Same goes for both wardrobe and music - not so broad, it’s subtle.

* Acting. Never liked Clara before - but boy they’re giving her room to really do her stuff. And Capaldi is a brilliant Doctor. Surely the best all around actor the show has had in the role - what range!, (as seen in Prime Suspect, In the Loop, etc.); yes, he’s angry, curmudgeonly , etc. but oh so Alien. Brilliant. Notice the wave of emotions that spread over his face as does his ‘LOOPER’ moment in this episode - as time becomes more fixed and he can see the future a bit more clearly. Or when PSY ‘dies’ in TIME HEIST and he seems not to care - but what we can see and the others don’t is that he’s doubting himself. And he’s been continually wrong in almost every episode.

What does all this add up to? 

A show with so much greater nuance than we’ve been given previously. 

Which is why I have been so stunned by the reaction in this board to KILL THE MOON. Oh so rarely in it’s 50 year history has a Doctor Who story been so nuanced; grappled with such moral questions where maybe there may not be a right answer, (and yes the abortion question is relevant here - it’s something the episode is thinking about - it’s one of the reasons why the episode was set on the Moon - a place that has always been symbolically linked with the female throughout human history.

I could go on and on about this episode. The astonishing shot of the protagonists on the beach watching the moon explode - brilliant shot; brilliant framing, delicate coloring, etc.

Yet there is something going on here that is really upsetting people. And it’s not just the ‘science’ being bad - cause if that was the case those folks wouldn’t be able to last through 10 minutes of any Doctor Who episode. 

No there’s something here which is really rubbing people the wrong way. People didn’t want the Doctor to leave - they want the Doctor to fix things; but the Doctor leaving was one of the most exhilarating moments I’ve ever seen in the history of the show, (I go way back to watching Tom Baker as the Doctor when I was a wee lad).

And my goodness - that scene in the Tardis at the end! One of the most adult scenes in I’ve ever seen in the show! 

Anyway could go on and on.

With the arrogance and whole ""I'm not sure if i'm a good man or not"" I think they are setting him up to go full on darkside with Clara being forced to kill the Doctor in the final episode of the arc. It would be even more interesting if the brought back a redeemed The Master into play to counterpoint the debasement of the Doctor. The most evil villain becomes good as The Doctor becomes evil, and once again Clara must sacrifice everything to save the Doctor from himself.

The inclusion of Courtney felt forced at best, she gets to tag along just because The Doctor made her feel bad? 

Clara's reaction at the end was brilliant, but forced and predictable. Not even a full episode before Dan the Soldier Man was telling her to ""let him know when she's been pushed too far."" An episode later she decides she's been pushed too far. I'm aware of the fact that Clara is likely leaving this season, but that doesn't have to make it feel rushed, meaningless, and predictable. Everyone knew the EXACT episode that the Pond's were leaving, but it still happened swiftly and still jerked a number of tears. Why make this so apparent and shove it down our throats?

They also missed a VERY large connection they could have made by making this a star whale. If they decide to destroy it, then the very thing that later saves humanity due to the crying children no longer exists and humanity just shot itself in the foot. 

I'm not inclined to agree with that 'anti-abortion' debate that's been happening here. I saw this as a typical ""scary alien vs. human tranquility"" problem that happens in Who frequently.

Three women (well, one woman unstopped by two others) make a literal ""my species, my choice"" decision for the entire world with complete disregard to what the world actually wants, and despite all realistic logic indicating that a catastrophe of epic proportions that will xenocide humanity should occur, everything wraps itself up tidily with absolutely zero repercussions because of their morally superior *niceness*.

Even ignoring everything else, when Clara exploded and went off on the Doctor, I was expecting one of two things to happen;

Path A: He shrugs, fiddles with some controls, walks out of the TARDIS, and as she's trying to leave behind him he shakes his head no and snaps his fingers, locking the doors on her. We hear the TARDIS whir, and then cold cut to the next episode preview; Clara, shunted to a crisis she must deal with without the Doctor there at all. He stays on Earth drinking non-alcoholic martinis, muttering to himself about how he refuses to take responsibility for a species that refuses to take responsibility for itself. Clara wraps up the episode starring her by making a devastating decision, is broken down in tears on the TARDIS afterwards, and a hidden timer goes off, summoning it back to the Doctor's side. He comes on board, sees her broken down in the chair, and just stands there staring at her until she looks up. ""Now you understand how I feel every time I have to make a decision for your species. What, were you expecting it to always be bloody wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey fun and games for the whole family? One more decision for you, then. Are you still coming along, or leaving?""

Path B: ""Get the fuckity fuck off of my bloody ship, then, you useless ingrate.""

Not this whole ""Oh, I'm so sorry that you don't like having to wear big kid undies now, and that I made you just once make the same decision that I have to make every time I time travel and mess with Earth's history. Can I take it back, Clara? Please forgive me, Clara? I'm sorry, Clara, just let me explain..."" bull.

And then when she goes tattling to Pink...

What the hell kind of soldier was he? ""Oh, the big mean alien made you grow up? Nobody should ever make someone else grow up! Why do you think I left the army?

Usually the Doctor is a man of science, and I like the episodes where he uses a mixture of cleverness/ science to solve the problems. Not a mcguffin. And as far as scientifically accuracy, I laughed at the fact that they used a shuttle to go to the moon. I don't fault the english for not knowing though, they've never been to the moon. They wouldn't know how you go about doing it. Also the whole emptiness of the shuttle and lack of organization was what irked me most. Things were just dangling about, and there was lots of empty space. Not too practical for a journey in space. And who just handed some chavs some nukes? You'd think that if someone was taking nukes to the moon they'd have an explosives expert, at the very least. 

Also the fact that the mexican lunar team took a freaking serape to the moon (in missions, every square inch counts, and a serape would take up too much space in lieu of equipment or other more crucial things). A FREAKING SERAPE! I lost it. If they also have a sombrero I'll never stop laughing. Also the writing was lazy. Which to me seems like a disservice to the great actors.

* Aliens that look perfectly human.
* Regenerating into a totally new person upon death.
* Time travel.
* Boxes that are bigger on the inside.
* Boxes that contain infinite space on the inside.

And those are the core premises of the show. That list does not contain the additional ""scientific inaccuracies"" that are present in each episode - were I to list each and every one of those, we'd be here a while.

[Here's something I think you dropped.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(cognitive\))

&gt;I'm not a screenplay writer, Peter Harness is.

Can you put that in an email with the subject line ""Shit I already know""?

&gt;Not to mention the assumed professionals who would have read the script and decided it was good enough to follow through with.

People who have been working on the show for literally years.

&gt;I don't have to be able to write a better script to see this episode had a bad one,

No, but it certainly helps your credibility.

&gt;just as you don't have to be able to design a game or direct a movie better than the one you are criticizing.

I wouldn't have to design a better game if I was criticising game-breaking bugs. But if I wanted to criticise the plot I'd at least have some suggestions for how it could have gone differently.

Anyway, this is all besides the point. You hate the new episodes, bully for you. Find a new series to bitch about if you hate this one so much.

They are nothing to be scared of at the Lane.

I'd love to play a two striker formation in this game as i think their defence is poor (especially with Yoshida possibly in for Gardos), but sacrificing a midfielder would probably me we would be overrun by Wanyama, Schneiderlin and Davis. I have a feeling that we'll stick with the same lineup as last week or maybe even play Mason at the head of a midfield 3, replacing Eriksen with a more robust player.

1. When they're trying to decide if they should detonate the bombs, and Danny is alluded to, Courtney freaking ribs Clara for her relationship (""Mrrrr Piiiiink."").  Is that really how anyone would react in that situation?
2.  The timelines are possibly a bit mucky.  In DW, humans traveled to Mars in 2041.  Could the Earth's space programs really be that dilapidated in that amount of time?  Did the writers not know about the timeline?  It's a small thing, and time can be rewritten.

I like the episode, because it further showed us what kind of a man this Doctor is.  For the most part, this season seems to be one giant chunk of character analysis, and I love it.  I like seeing how Clara is still trying to come to terms with the regeneration.  There's other reasons, but I'm pretty sure you are getting tired of reading this, so I'll just stop.

false,Alinosburns,null,null,"&gt; But, moving on. I'm sorry, but whatever you said about the birth killing the mother? It has zero bearing on the episode. The abortion angle was never handled at all.

The argument the whole way through for blowing up the moon. Was that not doing it would result in the Earth's destruction. That the creature might not leave, that the shell might hit and destroy earth.

If the argument is. Should we abort the baby that's about to come out of your womb for shits and giggles. Then of course no one is going to side on that.

But the situation that the episode played out was that in the event the creature hatches, the earth will likely be fucked.

And if it wasn't that it was a dandy TV show and the point was that the hatching was a wonderous event that inspired humanity. Odd's are the moon hatching would have had significant effects on the planet.

&gt;They always said baby. 

Because that's generally the way anti-abortion campaigns are targeted. Fetus sounds clinical and not-existant. They always use the word baby, because baby has better connotations and evokes a certain emotional reaction.

Just as someone will happily take a shovel to a snake that's roaming their farm. And anyone who lives in that sort of scenario won't bat an eye. Tell someone you're gonna take a shovel to a puppy and you've got a completely different angle.

&gt;They were never performing an abortion, they were killing a baby that was ready to live autonomously on the outside world. Actively killing a baby, not passively allowing it to die so the mother cold live.

But the same argument could be made for late stage abortions. Where a baby could be born premature and live but allowing that to occur would actively threaten/kill the mothers suvival.

Again the scenario laid out was that the egg hatching would result in the earths destruction. That was the question presented to earth. Not should we let the moon hatch because it's able to. But ""Should we let the moon hatch if it means our destruction?""

Which is why it comes of as anti-abortion and why it's a shittly written episode regardless. Because all of it is speculation, Now one could argue that it's that speculation that inspire humanity to stop killing each other. Because ""Maybe if we hadn't nuked X, We would have ended up with a positive result, maybe our destruction tendencies have prevented the ability for a positive result to arise.""

&gt;Also, the fact that it turns out ok in the end... I'm not sure how that adds anything to the abortion angle at all.

Is the biggest offender. The way most things portray it, life is a miracle, a joyous beautiful occasion with no negatives. And that in having an abortion you're denying that positive outcome. The end of the episode basically states, that nothing bad happened from not aborting the moon. Not even a slight bit of debris from the moon or the loss of the moon. 

Despite the terrible stakes the episode tried to convey nothing bad, not even side effect bad happened.

&gt;the Doctor was the only non-human present, not the only man;

Yet the script was clearly written where 3 women would decide the situation. Depsite previously having 2 men killed off after both were shown to basically be ""Second rate Astronauts""

By having both of the major players be female it brought on both sides of the argument in a stronger method. If they wanted to disassociate the abortion threads throughout they would have had a male presence during the deciding sequence to provide an alternative.

Instead we had 2 women, One who knew nothing of the terrors on earth as a result of the moon's changes and still had optimism. And one who had experienced a decade of negative effects from the moon to take the stance that destroying the moon was the best course of action.(even though we have no evidence that would have saved earth either, Which could be argued as better the devil we know than the devil we don't)

And then courtney running around in the background.

They also conveniently represented the Teenage, 20-30somethings and the 40+ range

&gt; 2) ... yes? It's a woman's body, after all. It is her choice.

Which is why it comes off more strongly as an abortion theme. combined with lines like ""It's your moon, womankind, it's your choice"" which if you want to argue that there isn't an abortion theme in there. Then there is no reason for that line to be stated in anyway.

&gt;IMO people are seeing an abortion debate where there isn't one, just because everyone really wants to. But I fail to see anything of the sort.

Which no offense could be argued exactly the opposite. You aren't seeing an abortion debate because you don't want to.

There is nothing wrong with having these sort of themes play through an episode, even if it is something that is as divisive as abortion. The problem is when the theme can't be dealt with properly within context of the plot.

Where did all the extra mass come from? None of the doctors alieny suggestions can be used since apparently its a natural space birth.

Why does the space butterfly need space wings?

Why can we hear crunchy foot steps on the moon?

Why can we hear a hatching space egg in vacuum and even if we could, why is it that sound is traveling at the speed of light?

Since the Tardis landed on a beach right under the thing hatching, WHERE IS THE SUPER HIGH TIDE!

Using a space plane designed for orbit as a moon ferry.All that extra weight of useless wings not to mention an apparently fully compressed cargo bay.Its fuel load would need to be almost as big as the shuttle its self. Rather than retrofit that, it would make much more sense to retrofit what ever the Mexicans used to land an entire moon base. Moonraker has more believable use of the Space Shuttle.

You sure that's all completely accurate? Seems like you edited his PL return to suit your story. I understand why gunners would be mad at him leaving because of how he did it. I don't get the anger about him wanting to come back, Arsenal and Wenger saying no, and him going to Chelsea. He made a mistake going to Barcelona and he did some stupid things to force the move, okay fine. But all this butthurt and delusion about justifying a board's cheap decision (a lot of signings over the summer fell through due to wages and there's no real excuse if Arsenal want to be a top club and not spend on areas of need like DM and ST) is what's funny.

&gt; that's not how Arsenal operates, that's how Chelsea does.

Maybe that isn't such a great thing if you guys are constantly never doing what's best for your team's success out of pride, being ""classy"" and this false moral superiority that you guys are doing it the ""right way."" 

&gt; any Arsenal fan you're trying to laughably insult by having him on your team, is obviously not a true Arsenal fan.

Cut your bullshit about ""true"" Arsenal fans because you disagree. Anybody who says a ""true"" X has to do Y is just an elitist who deems every other opinion that isn't like his to be plain wrong.

&gt; Imagine Lampard or Drogba up and cried their way out of your club in their primes, failed elsewhere, and came crawling back to CFC, how hard would you laugh? 

If our squad in this hypothetical was like your current one, I wouldn't be laughing. When a player like Fabregas is available, you get him. I'd get the excuse about not spending it on Cesc and elsewhere, but Arsenal didn't spend anywhere near the amount to get Fabregas on a striker or defensive mid.

Did I mention it was a planet-devouring space alien? No? Well, there's that too. There are certain points in time that Time Lords are not supposed to interfere with, this was one of them, and now Earth is going borderline extinct.

Special is extraordinary, Clara, and you lot have had billions of years and still haven't mastered the intergalactic equivalent of potty training. Now, I've been fathering your race from it's beginning to it's end, and I finally think you're ready to stop sleeping in the crib, and what do you do? You roll over and off the bed, you hit your head on the floor, you begin screaming at the injustice in the world that would so cruelly hurt you, and you get locked back in the crib for another few more millennia until ready to try again.""

&gt; Kill the Moon received near-universal acclaim from both critics and audiences, with both praising the writing, direction and Jenny Coleman's performance in particular.

&gt; Writing for the Telegraph, Ben Lawrence notes that ""Kill the Moon was an excellent example of Doctor Who reaching out to different generations, something it hasn’t always done in recent weeks."" He had praise for Coleman and Capaldi, noting that she was terrific and that he added layers of complexity to his character. Lawrence also states that the guests were underdeveloped, but concludes that, ""it lacked the clever-cleverness that has marred recent episodes and proved how good Doctor Who can be when it simply tells a story.""[15] Dan Martin whilst writing for the Guardian notes that ""Clara’s outburst was the next stage in what I have loved about this series most of all. More than ever before, they’re playing out the reality of running off to fight aliens with a time-travelling space detective. And, guess what, this life is not all wine and roses."" Martin notes that Coleman has been terrific all series stating that ""We no longer need to make note of just how good Jenna is this year; she’s already established herself in pantheon of all-time great companions.""[16]

Heaven forbid the show features a child on it! How terrible!  Heaven forbid that the child has very low self esteem.  Heaven forbid that the Doctor trusts his sanctimonious control freak companion to make the right decision.  

It is so easy to forget that those who travel with the Doctor are pushed to be better then they are. But through the eyes of Danny Pink this is bad.  Clara folded like a two dollar bill in this episode, though she ultimately made the right decision it was very difficult.  Because she was a control freak who in the moment of ultimate control hated being in control.

Courtney won't be back because her character made the point, in the same way that Clara made the point.  Courtney, afraid, smart aleck, a bit stupid and ultimately brave is a better companion then Clara who is far more experienced and is after all the impossible girl.  

In defense of Courtney, in an episode in which Clara threatens to slap the Doctor so hard he will regenerate, Courtney reminds us that to face our fears is the only way we grow.

Wrong wrong wrong

TO be a better capitalist you keep your costs down and thus use less resources whilst pushing the price up.

The environment has improved massively and continues to do so.

The Copenhagen consensus talk about it in this podcast

Do you have the premises? Are you paying business rates, employers tax, health and safety testing and paperwork? Electricity, sick/paternity leave.

Is it your intellectual property, did you prototype do the market analysis and ROI for tooling and securing finance.

Then do it. There has never been an easier time to become a capitalist

And even if he somehow was, I think it would actually be a disservice to make him the Valeyard because it would totally ruin the poignancy of Twelve questioning what kind of man he is. The Valeyard is straight up evil and irrevocably and unashamedly so. It is pretty clear that Twelve wants to and is trying to be a good man. It would take a serious and earth shatteringly devastating chain of events to make Twelve become the Valeyard.But most importantly we know that the Valeyard is not a true incarnation of the Doctor but rather an amalgamation of the Doctor's darker nature who is not a true individual entity which is why he tries to steal the Doctor's regenerations/life. Eleven directly regenerated into Twelve so unless this is somehow already the Valeyard masquerading as Twelve and the real Twelve is somehow somewhere elsewhere, I don't see it happening.So while not saying it can't happen, I find it pretty implausible. Edit: My personal dream theory of the Valeyard's return would involve the Doctor finally finding Gallifrey but as an unforeseen consequence unleashes the Valeyard's revenge. If we take out Trial of the Valeyard for a moment, the Valeyard was last seen on the series as the Keeper of the Matrix on Gallifrey, which he could use to create a lot of trouble for Gallifrey and the Doctor.

There's a reason he didn't cut it at Barcelona, because he was playing poorly and it was agitating not just the upper echelon of the club, but the fans as well. We have no use for Fabregas in a midfield that already has Cazorla, Ozil, Wilshere, Ramsey, Rosicky, and now even Diaby returning. You can judge their merits and quality compared to that of Cesc but regardless, that would mean we were willing to bring in a player to overload an already overloaded central midfield and allow the return of a player who's desperate attempt to come back and thinks he is above the club. It's not him leaving and how he left that hurt Arsenal fans, it's that he chose the absolute worst time to leave and as much as I'd like to use the word 'stifled', it would be an understatement to what he did. I guess Arsene is an absolute fucking idiot for taking the likes of Sanchez, a player capable of scoring in big games as he showed in his World cup performances as well as at Barcelona, and Ozil, another player who put in countless excellent performances for Madrid (and to pile on, statistically has outperformed Fabregas for several seasons now). I guess we should take the Barca reject who couldn't hack it and went AWOL for every big fixture they had. The last time Chelsea won the title, they built a solid squad from their foundations and years of molding players into quality talent, it was respectable. You had a respectable manager in Ancelotti, a respectable squad with Drogba, Lampard, Essien, etc., and you won in quality fashion. I applaud that, but you're naive if you think the way your club operates now is anything like that of what you used to be. I was a keen admirer of Chelsea and the way they played, but I can't even muster an ounce of that nostalgia to how Mourinho and Abramovic have gone about it, and it goes to show that you don't have to run a club that way to succeed, otherwise you're no better than Man City buying the title. You can scrutinize Arsenal for not buying a defensive mid, I'll gladly join you, but as supporter of football, you should be with idealists like myself in abolishing the atrocities of financial fairplay and anti football that Mourinho has instilled in a once flourishing side who didn't have to resort to those tactics to beat top teams.

&gt;__TARDIS coral__ was the organic substance of which the Doctor's TARDIS was composed. The vessels were grown, not built. (TV: *The Impossible Planet*) The interior of the War Doctor, Ninth Doctor, Tenth Doctor, and Eleventh Doctor's TARDIS had a coral-like appearance; there were several pillars that seemed more like trees or vines than structural support, and a coral-like substance around portions of the structure. 
&gt;However, when briefly merged with his tenth incarnation's TARDIS, the Doctor's fifth incarnation noted that the coral structures could be part of the current TARDIS' ""desktop theme."" He also suggested that it was worse than the ""leopard skin"" appearance. (TV: *Time Crash*)

false,steveosmith,null,null,"Apparently i'm not on here enough to notice the backlash, but I thought that was a fantastic episode. Why?     
We see more of the ""raw"" doctor. He knew, almost from the start, what was going on. Hence why he's playing with gravity. He's not some redneck from hicksville, he's a timelord who has seen the entirety of the universe. While i'm not sure the creature in the moon was unique (it laid it's own egg after it left), i'm willing to bet it's the first one humanity has ever seen. And the whole world saw it. They saw something amazing, together. The torchwood tie-in here was great, where he basically goes over their mission statement and what Jack's always harping on about...how we needed to be ready, because the middle of the 21st century is when everything changes, and he's talking about how in the middle of the 21st century, mankind did something right, saw something beautiful that it didn't want to destroy, and took off for the stars, expanding to the edge of the universe and enduring until the end of time itself (which is probably why the Doctor is so fond of humans in general, as they're probably *everywhere* by the time Gallifrey falls)     
     
We get to see Clara dedicated for an episode, instead of flipping back and forth towards Mr. Pink and the Doctor. I didn't like that episode because it was too disjointed. Just her and the Doctor really. The little girl too by chance, but I have a feeling she plays a future role (he even says she goes on to be the first female president.) in the show. maybe not as *her* obviously. But who knows? In this episode we recapture that essence of Clara you got from the very beginning at the Dalek Asylum. Timid, Fearful. Serious. When reality hits her, it knocks her off her fantasy ride with the Doctor and makes her realize exactly what kind of decisions he makes every day. It was a poor way to test someone, but she was losing focus. trying to divide her time between Mr. Pink and The Doctor. And still find time for school. But she's always been ""along for the ride"". Never really taking responsibility for her actions.     
      
I can see how, initially, people think this is some sort of anti-abortion bit, but I think you're missing the forest for the trees. This is about morality in general. Humanity is corrupt. This is clear when the whole world shuts off it's light and says ""blow it up!"" ... They were all willing to die anyway, as long as they took the ""monster"" with it. They didn't even want to consider the matter. How are we, as humans, ever supposed to expand our horizons if we can't stop shooting at anything that isn't like us? I mean, whats the cause of war in general? one group of people hates another group of people enough to do whatever it can to destroy them. As a civilization, some day, we're going to need to change. What if there *is* life out there? Are we just going to exterminate everything we run into?      
I understand, before you say it, that Doctor Who *is* science fiction. However, most sci-fi writers work with ""probables"". Things that could conceivably happen. And it really hit home because we *have* all but given up on the stars. Sure we still launch probes now and then to mars and the moon, and yes, we have high hopes of putting people on the moon and on mars in the next 50 years. But we already *know* there's no other discernable life forms in this solar system. We need to look further. We aren't working on the latest ship to land us on pluto. Or beyond. Something like this could unite a people towards a common good, and it only befits Doctor Who to join the long lineage of sci-fi shows that teach how ones morality is always in question and it is the collective choices we make that have lasting consequences. Big things happen in tiny moments.     
Lasty, I think this was one of the first real episodes ""without a villian"" in a long time. I also think that this was a deep personal stab (as much as one can make from a TV show) about how we aren't measuring up anymore. Would you have kept your lights on? or turned them off? Either way, the moon was going away. Either way the Earth was fucked. But because they chose life (and by they I mean the three of them on the moon, and not humanity), the space dragon laid another egg to keep for another 100 million years. Humanity is saved. *shrug*

false,littlemissjess,null,null,"Early years teacher here! 

We work with a range of pupils who all have completely different needs.  We have to take each child as an individual and look at what their next step is. We then have to assess how to best help that specific child meet that step. We do not care about the ethnicity and back ground of each child, we love them all the same and want the very best for each one. 

To plan well for EAL students you have to create a completely different curriculum, that takes up your personal time, because they cannot learn in the same way as a child who can speak English.  But you do it. Because you care about that child. You imagine how frightening it must be for them to be in a situation where they have no idea what is being asked of them,  when the other children seem to magically know what the teacher wants them to do, and where they might get told off if they can't work it out. Where they can't communicate basic needs with the adults and children around them.

So, for children who don't speak English their next steps are going to be to become more confident with using the language that will help them access education and wider society.  The best way to learn a language is by having real life experiences. Trying to learn the word ""pumpkin"" from looking at an abstract concept like a picture is not as useful as learning the word from holding/smelling/tasting a pumpkin... an experience that will stay with them, and make that learning stay with them.

So, I get given some money *specifically* to help EAL children achieve this next step. Yes I spend it on real life experiences.  Even better! I find a way to use it to help the parents see how we teach English. Where I can share the importance of making learning fun and engaging, interactive and not expecting their 5 year old to want to sit down and fill out worksheets. Now I'm a racist?! Oh boi.

The other children wouldn't mind that they are not on a trip because ""being made to go to class"" is not a punishment.  I love this job. I love my children.  I work hard to make the children love it too. The best way to learn is to *want* to learn.  So we have to make classes more fun than anything else a 4 year old would want to do.. and we do.

If you join an IAM group they will push you to take the IAM test, a RoSPA group the RoSPA test, the tests are pretty well equivalent, except that the IAM is pass or fail, the RoSPA is graded with Bronze generally considered an IAM fail, Silver a pass and Gold a good pass. 

I enjoyed the instruction, and I think I'm probably a better rider for it. Initially I was quite sceptical, but it's hard to argue that it isn't worthwhile when you don't know what it is. I would recommend the instruction, because there's a chance it may be useful and increase your enjoyment of riding. There isn't really a downside, if you don't like what they say, don't do it. 

The tests are only useful if you like testing yourself or a looking for a discount on your insurance :-) ",0,1412496539,null,0,false,0,cl0v3at,t3_2ibeze,t1_cl0v3at,t3_2ibeze,null,1426676969,3,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3

I've only seen it once, but I thought the choice was between:

1. saving the moon, thereby almost certainly wiping out humanity and most life on earth;

2. killing the moon, thereby saving humanity and every other living thing known to man.

Of course it was a false choice... but it was falsified via a rather convenient miracle destroying the old moon remnants and laying a sufficiently massive and inactive new moon egg, neither of which I think many would bet the continuation of their species on.

Ethically, it looked like there was a real dilemma, but not about which option had better consequences. It looked more like a battle between consequentialism and deontology. The consequentialist would weight one life (the moon) against every other life and go with the greatest good, thus choosing to kill the moon. In contrast the deontologist would consider some acts good and some acts bad regardless of consequences, never choosing to kill an innocent life even if that meant the end of humanity, thus letting the moon live.",0,1412497373,null,0,1412499460,0,cl0v9br,t3_2ic2kk,t1_cl0v9br,t1_cl0urzv,null,1426676890,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

Johnson is the opposite, very passive defensively, but does carry the ball (sometimes too much). This does help create space for other players, but when he's off form he ends up running down blind alleys and losing it.

For me, lack of exposition is a problem with all programmes, not just new vs classic Who. Shorter run-times and higher expectations of action from viewers mean that plot explanation is always sacrificed at the altar of editing.

As for there being better storytelling in almost any other sci-fi series, I'd dispute that. The writing in most other series is far more formulaic and, while Who often gets it wrong, it doesn't have the benefit of existing in the same fixed universe in the same genre every week. Consecutive episodes have far less in common than on other shows - take The Caretaker and Time Heist, for example. That puts much more strain on the writers to reinvent elements of the programme every week. (And when they do employ continuity, the forums are up in arms about the show becoming too much of a sopa opera.)

I don't mean to sound like a NuWho apologist, but I do believe that there are a lot of viewers out there who have unrealistic expectations of what can be achieved in a 45-minute episode.

false,SilenceFall,null,null,"It wasn't just bringing the characters back that RTD did. There's hardly a series 3 episode where the Doctor wouldn't mention Rose and IMO the character of Martha suffered a lot due to 1) constantly hanging onto Rose and comparing Martha to her.

I believe you also have to look at it from the Doctor's POV. 9 and 10 lived within just a few years on the show, so it is logical that they were surrounded by the very same people and that they mentioned these people a lot even when they were gone as it's been only a short time since they last saw them.

But for 11 it has been hundreds of years since he interacted with Rose an co by series 6 and for 12 it has been an even much longer time. It's just like in real life, for example when you are a university, you are surrounded by this set of people and you might spend most of your time with them, but then you go seperate ways and you might stay in touch, but eventually they fade from you and you only ever rarely think of them or meet them as you are then surrounded with a completely new set of people.

Also, with 11 it even was a part of his character as the man who doesn't like endings and the man who forgets. And it wasn't just about RTD's era, but even about Moffat's previous characters. 11 has spent hundreds of years traveling with the Ponds and with River and yet after The Angels Take Manhattan he never mentions Amy or Rory to Clara or anyone else (until he sees Amelia before regeneration) or River until he is forced to by being confronted with her ghost in The Name of the Doctor. But he makes small references to companions who have traveled with him long before the Ponds on a few occasions, so maybe it was just that thinking of the more recent companions hurt him too much.

12 seems to be different in this as he already mentioned both Amy and River so far, so we might get references to RTD's characters as well.",0,1412498464,null,0,false,0,cl0vgrg,t3_2i8kwh,t1_cl0vgrg,t1_cl0ejxw,null,1426676795,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The 'right to buy' was originally a Labour Party policy for a start. The reason being that the affluent could store their earnings in property while lower paid workers lost their earnings in rent.

It was also a Labour opposition that prevented the Conservative government from requiring that local authorities spend the proceeds of council house sales on new social housing stock (Labour's argument being that national government cannot tell local government how to spend its money).

The people who bought council houses were not rich property tycoons, and safeguards about immediate resale were built in.

The main issue is the lack of replacement of social housing stock.

It isn't blind Moffat hate. My fave episodes are written by him. The 'scary' episodes for example this season's 'Listen' are brilliant and I couldn't imagine anyone else that would write as good as him. 

Also he has chosen brilliant people for example Matt Smith was a brilliant Doctor but I and a lot of people believe he was let down by the writing. And Capaldi is quickly becoming one of my fave Doctors and is honestly a brilliant actor but again I don't feel he has been given enough chance to shine yet and I think an episode or two where he is without Clara will show just how incredible he is. 

But when Moffat is in charge of the show and who writes for it, who stars in it and all that when there are more dull or just ok episodes than there are good episodes and brilliant episodes then the buck stops with him.

I feel like [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/FkxEV15.png) is a pretty good sum-up of how Doctor Who is written these days. 

I know it's not really what this thread is for, but I think Doctor Who at this point should be more of a Detective story. I think that's what it's trying to be right now, but it's just not supplying because of its bad writing and plot holes. It has all the set-up of a great mystery story, wherein everything is displayed to the audience and it all fits into place at the end. But they don't. They give a half-assed conclusion anybody could have guessed with a bit of ""Oh yeah magic shit"" and then that's all folks.

false,AtariBigby,null,null,"The so-called Islamic State (Isis) is engaged in a propaganda war. It is a war that democrats should refuse to fight on the terrorists' terms.
Isis wants to provoke the West into overreacting, so that it can present its adherents as soldiers in a war between civilisations. It hopes that beheading hostages will help to escalate outside intervention in Iraq and Syria, which would feed an ideology that sees Western foreign policy as a crusade against Muslims. More than that, it hopes to inspire disturbed and rootless young men with its ferocity and self-belief, in order to recruit them to its cause.

We should be careful, therefore, how we respond to the news of Alan Henning's murder. The Independent on Sunday refuses to use footage from Isis videos, and we try to avoid any suggestion in our reports that Isis has widespread support or that its followers are motivated by religious devotion.

Most British media organisations seem to have come to a similar conclusion, after some confusion in response to earlier atrocities. The use of terror as a tactic is not new, but the internet has changed the media environment beyond recognition. Some editors made the mistake of thinking that, because videos are available online, linking to them or using stills from them was a value-free decision. Of course it is no such thing.

Giving publicity to Isis is like paying ransom to more conventional hostage-takers: it is what the terrorists seek, and giving it to them indiscriminately is helping their cause. Just because there are no rules on their side does not mean there are no rules on the side of respect for life and human rights.

We aim to report the facts, without going into excessive detail about the ways in which Isis murders its victims, and to provide the information the reader needs to understand the tangled situation across the Middle East.

Instead of dwelling on Mr Henning's death we have sought to focus on his life: his humanity, his courage and his devotion to the cause of helping civilians in Syria's civil war. His commitment to saving lives and easing suffering offers a powerful contrast to the values of his captors, glorying in torture and death.

There are those who suggest that last month's House of Commons' vote to allow British forces to take part in air strikes against Isis played into the terrorists' hands. That Isis is trying to provoke a Western military response should be only one consideration in assessing what the West should do. In any event, we should not confuse caution with washing our hands of responsibility.

There is a difference between overreaction and a measured response. Public opinion in this country supports American air strikes in support of local forces on the ground, Iraqi, Kurdish and Syrian, as they try to push back the Isis advance. It is important that other Muslim states are involved in these operations.

The significant thing is not the token UK involvement in air strikes, but the effort to promote political settlements, with all the costs that entails, in Iraq and Syria that would minimise local support for Isis. That said, if the Prime Minister believes that UK forces need to operate in Syria as well as Iraq, as we suspect he does, he should have the courage to make that case in public and to seek Parliament's approval.

We should steel ourselves for further horrors. Isis knows no restraint in its search for ways to shock and intimidate its enemies.

In the face of such cruelty and delusion on the part of Isis, it is hard to formulate a response, especially when the diplomatic and military options are so complex and morally compromised. But one thing that we can do is to refuse to play Isis's propaganda game.

From all the things I've learned over the past few months and without knowing the specifics - I implore you to half that £600 'expendable' cash, put £300 towards a long-term plan (pension) and the other half on building up a solid savings/bank balance (you could have £10k in 3 years) from which you can do any number of things - the deposit for a house would be an obvious one...

...on another and completely curious note what would the monthly repayments on a 30k R cost?

Which is kind of one of the arguments against abortion you have no idea when a baby is sentient when it can think for itself. This is even more of an unknowable with this creature.

&gt;last of it's kind alien vs human race then that's up to them.

The only evidence we have that it's the last of it's kind Is the doctors belief.

But the thing is you can't deny that the elements are there along with some pretty overt lines like ""it's your moon womankind it's your choice""

Even if you want to argue the that it's not mean to be a direct analog to abortion. The fact is that enough of the theme is there to support it.

And if you don't want to see it that way that's fine. But just as people used to bitch about RTD's need to have gay characters where they weren't needed. The underlying abortion themes in this episode also weren't needed. And I think the reason they struck a cord with some of the community is because of how much bullshit is in the episode to facilitate the plot they have in the first place. Conversion of mass would dictate that the moon can't get denser without having absorbed something else at somepoint but that's not even touched on. 

Giant single celled life forms. I might be able to get behind. But 4ft spiders aren't a single cell. The fact that they have things like appendages and the ability to leave behind intricate cobwebs distinguishes them from that.

They may well be bacteria but there was no need to say shit like single celled beings. 

The fact that there were no negative repercussions not even a chunk of moon hitting the earth. The fact that the ocean/lake they were standing near had no relation to a Giant creature laying a moon and then flying off.  The removal of the extra gravity would have had similar issues for earth.

&gt;
&gt;Nyssa first met the Doctor in his fourth incarnation when he was travelling with Adric in 1981. She had recently attended the wedding of her long-widowed father Tremas to Kassia. Unbeknownst to her, the Master had also come to Traken and was planning to exploit the tremendous power of the Keepership (to which her father was the only rightful heir) to live beyond his last natural regeneration. The Doctor and Adric stopped the Master from taking over the Keepership, but could not prevent his killing Nyssa's new stepmother. They were also unable to stop the Master from killing Tremas by transferring his essence into Tremas' body (having already departed from Traken), which left Nyssa orphaned in her young adulthood. (TV: *The Keeper of Traken*)
&gt;Soon after, the Watcher took Nyssa to the planet Logopolis in the Doctor's TARDIS. She discovered the Master had, in effect, killed her father. He enslaved her mind, involving her in his complex plan to conquer the universe. The Doctor soon broke her free of the Master's spell, then entered into an uneasy alliance with the Master. The two Time Lords and Tegan rushed to Earth in the Master's TARDIS to halt the waves of rampant entropy the Master had unleashed upon the universe. Adric and Nyssa were left with the Doctor's TARDIS on Logopolis. The Watcher helped Adric transport the duo back to Earth. En route, Nyssa witnessed the entire Traken Union being swept away by the growing entropy field which threatened the existence of every part of N-Space. She knew she was the last of her entire species by the time the TARDIS materialised on Earth. When she next met the Doctor, he was mortally wounded in his successful battle to stop the Master. He regenerated, never having travelled with her in the TARDIS. (TV: *Logopolis*)

It is possible to be creative but not really to be original. Almost any episode is going to rehash plot threads from another. Even many of your favorite episodes probably draw on or rehash old episodes.Some examples:Dalek is considered by many to be the Ninth Doctor's quintessential outing, however it I repurposed many elements from a Sixth Doctor audio called Jubilee which was intentional as they were written by the same author. The regeneration coma/trauma that the Tenth Doctor goes through in The Christmas Invasion is pretty similar to what Five went through in Castrovalva. And the end is pretty much Doctor Who and the Silurians.A time travel companion that meets the Doctor(s) in the wrong order or otherwise has a complicated temporal relationship with the Doctor describes River Song who first appeared in Silence in the Library. This was started with Mel in Classic Who and continued in the audios long before River Song. There was also Charley Pollard, who met and travelled around with the Eighth Doctor before meeting and travelling with the Sixth.The Racnoss Queen in The Runaway Bride is really not too different from and has similar goals to The Great One in Planet of the Spiders.The Stolen Earth is not the first time the Daleks tried to move the Earth and use it as a kind of engine. This first occurs in the Dalek Invasion of Earth.Even an episode like Daleks in Manhattan/Evolution of the Daleks draws on a Classic episode. The Daleks trying to use human beings as a source to improve themselves first cropped up in The Evil of the Daleks.I could easily go over the character limit making these parallels/comparisons.Also the rehashing of some older episodes, ideas, and villains is intentional by Moffat for the story arc. It has been about the Doctor confronting his past decisions and questioning if he is still a good man.",0,1412502106,null,0,false,0,cl0w2uv,t3_2icblq,t1_cl0w2uv,t3_2icblq,null,1426676508,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

Even Robots, which is campy and silly in many ways, I do love because it is campy and silly - because it is pulled off pretty good, in my opinion. Listen is simply brilliant, Time Heist is entertaining... I could go on and on. And then Kill the Moon happened.

While this episode is enjoyable and quotable at some points, it's still mediocre at best. *Humanity has lost interest in the rest of the universe, they observe at best, no moon missions, no mars missions, they stay on their planet and that's it. But then something happens that inspires them to reach out for the stars again...* OK, interesting premise. And the resolution of it is... nice (and the scene at the beach is beautiful), but there are some points overall that concern me with this episode:

* Courtney Woods
* Spider Germs
* ""You humans sort this one out by yourself, not my planet, I'm off, fuckity-bye!""
* ""Look, it laid a new egg!"" (I literally facepalmed, welcome back Status Quo Ante)
* Clara turned her bitch factor up to eleven and her PMS power was over 9.000! (Sry ladies...) What the hell was THAT?

The Doctor may have been right about letting humans decide this one on their own. I even get him running away. Since the star whale was brought up here many times, think about it - he would be an accomplice to infanticide. Doctor, eh? Still, he should've stayed and at least offer some advice or consolation. Clara was right about one thing - he acted like a patronizing asshole before buggering off. But when 12 got his well-deserved scolding, she was more angry about him running away then the  way he acted (which was more insulting in my opinion). And then she overshot the target and ""quit"" as his companion/carer? I think the writers wanted to seperate them and botched the job.

""Well, I never!""

""Good, I like nevers, they're so... definitively aggressive. Like my eyebrows! Goodbye, then! Oh and Clara, watch your step when leaving. Wouldn't want the TARDIS door to whack you on the bum if you miscalculate your huffy little door slam. You seem to keep forgetting that your rear is bigger on the outside.""

**Episode 2:**

""Doctor, we can't kill a fire ant worker, not even to save every other sentient life throughout time and space!""

""Okay, I'm leaving you with Socrates for the next hundred years, you can get back on  my case about moral quandries once you actually know what the bloody hell you're talking about.

""You can-not escape, Doc-tor! Not with all your oldest foes gathered to defeat yo...""

""Not trying to escape, you imbecile.

No? First time for everything, I suppose. Goodbye!""

**Epsiode 3.2:**

""Oh, did I mention that infinity is rather large? Yeah, I'm not limited to just one target with this. The rest of you are screwed, too.""

**Episode 4:**

""You know, I really wish I had a time machine so I could go back and fix all those mistakes I've made over the years. Oh, that's right, I doooo! Fancy that! Off I go, then! First stop, Britain, 2014, BBC Studios.

""No, the Doctor is a young man with bad dress sense, not an old man with bad dress sense.""

""Yep.""

""Well, who is he? Future King of Scotland? His Royal Majesty? President of the United States?""

false,stzp,null,null,"&gt; Tories are proposing to have the ECHR interpreted by British courts instead of European ones. That's it. They aren't scrapping the principles of the ECHR.

The ECHR specifically says that it is to be interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights and that governments must abide by the Court's decisions:

&gt; ARTICLE 19: To ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by
the High Contracting Parties in the Convention and the Protocols
thereto, there shall be set up a European Court of Human Rights,
hereinafter referred to as “the Court”. It shall function on a
permanent basis.

&gt; ARTICLE 32: The jurisdiction of the Court shall extend to all matters
concerning the interpretation and application of the Convention
and the Protocols thereto which are referred to it as provided in
Articles 33, 34, 46 and 47.
In the event of dispute as to whether the Court has jurisdiction,
the Court shall decide.

&gt; ARTICLE 46: The High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the final
judgment of the Court in any case to which they are parties...

The government can't just pick and choose which bits of a treaty it wants to abide by: the idea of remaining in the Convention but rejecting the Court's authority doesn't make the slightest bit of sense.  Either this is a token pre-election promise that the Tories don't intend to deliver on, or they are deliberately heading for an ugly confrontation with the Council of Europe and the other member states, or they just don't understand how any of this works (frankly I suspect a mixture of the first and third options).

&gt; Firstly, as I just said, leaving the Human Rights Act doesn't mean leaving the ECHR, it will instead be interpreted by British courts.

The whole point of the Human Rights Act was to enable British courts to interpret and apply the ECHR so that people wouldn't have to take their cases to Strasbourg in the first instance.

&gt; Secondly, neither currently or under any proposals for change can the European Courts or if under these proposals, it is interpreted by the British Supreme Court, can they prevent Parliament from doing anything. They can ignore it now.

By talking about ""European Courts"" in the plural you are muddying the waters: the courts can (and [have](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28Factortame_Ltd%29_v_Secretary_of_State_for_Transport)) effectively strike down primary and secondary legislation that violates EU law - of course, Parliament could get around this by pulling out of the EU altogether, but this is still very arguably a limit on parliamentary sovereignty.

When it comes to the European Court of Human Rights, the government can technically ignore its rulings (though often that would mean passing further legislation to prevent domestic courts from automatically taking them into account under the Human Rights Act), but the consequences for the UK's international relations are severe enough that it doesn't really happen.",0,1412505722,null,0,false,0,cl0wnpk,t3_2i9sy1,t1_cl0wnpk,t1_cl06773,null,1426676238,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

**Edit**: Alright, I guess I'll elaborate. First of all, let's get this out of the way: I don't actually think there's really much in the way of an abortion analogy in the episode at all. If there *is*, it's pretty clearly pro-choice, but it's a tenuous analogy at best, so fuck it, I'm done arguing about the episode itself.

But on to the *actual* point: I have never said or implied that abortion is bad in any way, shape or form. If someone I had knocked up decided to have an abortion, I would support that decision *one hundred fucking percent*.

On the other hand though, if she decided that she didn't want to have an abortion, *whatever the reason for that might be*, I would completely support that decision as well. Yes, even if the reason was because she decided that she *personally* didn't want to be responsible for ""killing"" her unborn foetus. 

Whether I am OK with it or not is irrelevant, because (and I know you already said you don't like hearing this) it's *not my body*, so *it's not my choice to make*. And if you disagree with that at all, then you're dictating to women what they can do with their own body, which makes you exactly as bad as a pro-lifer.",0,1412506217,null,0,1412513174,0,cl0wqgn,t3_2iazo2,t1_cl0wqgn,t1_cl0vu14,null,1426676202,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

&gt;Of course

&gt;&gt; You do realise some of our biggest investors are from Saudi and UAE right?

&gt;I don't see how this is important, this is the same Saudi that funds terrorism (with ""friends like that"" and has an awful human rights record. As for the investments they have, so what, they are unlikely to withdraw them and if they did...Saudi GDP is 750 billion, UK's alone is 2.5 trillion, we'd survive, Saudi wouldn't without US support for very long.

You do realise GDP is representative of wealth distribution? Not actual wealth? In terms of wealth, Saudi shits all over the west with near on $1 trillion in assets, the UK doesn't even rank. We're dependent on outside investment, Saudi aren't. 

&gt;&gt; You really don't want to be turning muslim nations against us unless you fancy pay £7-8 per litre of petrol.

&gt;1) They wouldn't stop selling the oil for any length of time since, it would decimate their economy (GDP of Saudi is 750 billion, UK's is 2.5 trilling, US north of 12 Trillion) b) China won't want much more if the west economy is not growing.

See above.

&gt;
2) Lets assume that your estimate of prices per litre is right (and it's really not, £3-4 over the time it takes for new fields that are now *very* viable and then a drop after that) it would spur us quite rapidly to remove the dependency we current have on oil and make other technologies more viable.

""There's no genetic difference"". The fact is that according to vastly documented science there IS genetic difference between the races and it is still an open question as to how much that difference is and what effects it has. I will have to argue with your assertion that the differences are ""minute"" as well.

It is a fact that African's have a genetic difference in their VO2 Max by up to 30% - lets take a look at the current world records and their holders.

100 metres - 9.58 - Usain Bolt (Jamaica), west African decent

200 metres - 19.19 - Usain Bolt (Jamaica), west African decent

400 metres - 43.18 - Michael Johnson (USA), west African decent

800 metres - 1:41.11 - Wilson Kepketer (Denmark), African decent

1000 metres - 2:11.96 - Noah Ngeny (Kenya), east Africa

1500 metres - 3:26.0 - Hicham El Guerrouj (Morocco), north Africa

Mile - 3:43.13 - Hicham El Guerrouj (Morocco), north Africa

2000 metres - 4:44.79 - Hicham El Guerrouj (Morocco), north Africa

5000 metres - 12:37.35 - Kenenisa Bekele (Ethiopia), east Africa

10,000 metres - 26:17.53 - Kenenisa Bekele (Ethiopia), east Africa

Half marathon - 58:33 - Samuel Winjiru (Kenya), east Africa

Marathon - 2:03.59 - Haile Gebrselassie (Ethiopia) east Africa


Seeing any pattern there? Africans have genetic advantages when it comes to V02 max, and for example the variants of ACTN3 gene which gives a more efficient fast twitch muscle type. So certainly when it comes to physical make up the differences are apparent and they can make very large differences in the real world.

They didn't. They want to get to Britain for some reason rather than staying in France, which is a safe country. At this point, they're economic migrants not asylum seekers and they should absolutely be refused entry.

But basically this:

* You have a ""family doctor"" known as a GP (general practitioner), who you will need to register with. They will be your main port of call for non-urgent problems such as chronic illnesses, minor diseases or infections, or persistent pain. They may be able to treat you there and then or prescribe medicines, or they may need to refer you a specialist at a hospital.

* For urgent but non life-threatening problems, such as a sprained wrist or a cut that requires stitches, you are normally expected to go to your local walk-in centre or treatment clinic. Many people go to A&amp;E at their nearby hospital for this sort of thing, but that's not what A&amp;E is for and you therefore might have to wait a very long time to be seen while the staff (not unreasonably) deal with people who would otherwise be about to die without medical help. The clinic is a far better bet.

* For emergency or life-threatening  issues go to A&amp;E at the hospital. If necessary dial 999 to get an ambulance to take the patient there. As before though, if it's not life-threatening then neither A&amp;E nor an ambulance are a shortcut to getting treatment.

* Other health services such as physio are usually covered by the NHS, however you need to be referred to the relevant specialist by your GP. In many ways the GP acts as a gatekeeper to the other services, so it's worth looking at the reviews on www.nhs.uk and making sure you register with a practice that is recommended. You don't have to register with your nearest GP (although in high-demand areas, such as poorer and inner-city neighbourhoods, you might find that not all GPs will accept new patients).

* Blood tests would be available on the NHS if they were required as part of a diagnosis. If it's to meet employer's or insurance requirements, however, then you'll probably have to pay.

* Dental and optical treatment is subsidised rather than free -- dentists and opticians have a set of fees that they're allowed to charge their patients for any given treatment. However those in receipt of certain welfare benefits also get free dental and optical treatment.

* Prescriptions, no matter what the drug, are charged at a flat fee (again, those in receipt of benefits get them for free).

Britain does also have a thriving private healthcare system, if you have private health insurance or the cash you can of course get treatment for anything you want, whenever you want. Frequently however the same doctors treat both private and NHS patients, so going private doesn't really guarantee you better treatment, merely shorter waiting times and posher hospital rooms.

The above all applies only for the NHS in England -- there are slightly different rules and more free treatment available for people in Wales, Scotland, and N.I.",0,1412507321,null,0,1412507857,0,cl0wwql,t3_2iclat,t1_cl0wwql,t3_2iclat,null,1426676121,47,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,47

&gt;

&gt;__Telescoping generations__ can occur in [parthenogenetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenetic) species, such as [aphids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphid) or other life forms that have the ability to reproduce without ovum fertilization. This occurrence is characterized by a [viviparous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viviparous) female having a daughter growing inside her that is also parthenogenetically pregnant with a daughter cell.

&gt;This pattern of reproduction can also occur in certain [mites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite) that are technically not parthenogenetic, e.g. *[Adactylidium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adactylidium)*, in which the young hatch and mate within the mother, eating her from the inside and then escaping; in some species the males never escape, and in others they die shortly afterwards. However, the resulting inbreeding has consequences much like those of parthenogenesis, and the females are not actually pregnant on hatching but become pregnant before emerging into free living.

Print revenues reached a peak in around 2000, and then dropped off significantly, mostly due to the internet. Not only can people access news for free online, but classified ads too which often provided a much-needed income source to printed newspapers. The internet presents a huge opportunity for newspapers which many of them are very pleased about content-wise, but revenues are tiny compared to the heyday of print.  

Now newspapers have to fire hundreds of staff in order to reduce their losses, and are turning to new strategies, such as online paywalls, bought-in content (video and articles written by agencies) and unique opinion articles written by expensive writers (cf. Jeremy Clarkson for The Sun, Charlie Brooker in The Guardian etc.) more and more.

One of the big problems I had was how the characters who are supposed to be smart make stupid decisions. 

Ok - so the doctor can't see the future due to this particular event, but he can see the past. Why didn't they check out the past to see if they can learn anything?

They played Russian Roulette with the world instead of making an *informed choice*, and referring to the thing as a ""baby"" was I thought unnecessary. 

And seriously - ""I knew you'd do the right thing"" when even he didn't know (apparently) what the right thing was? I think Clara's rebuke was the only thing about the whole episode that made sense. 

And Clara allowing a student on board the TARDIS was a questionable decision if there ever was one. 

What was the point of the spiders? 

Why use fantastical science just cause? And not explore it either as a plot device or as a source of wonder (a. la. magic in Harry Potter)?

And everyone's choice is justified in retrospect.

You might also want to follow Probo Titans on facebook as well, they put on regular math-rock and noise-rock nights at the Stag and Hounds as well as gigs for a local bands and smaller bands touring around the area. The stuff they promote isn't metal, it's mostly instrumental, experimental stuff. But it has got lots of noisy, distorty parts so it crosses over well to metal fans who are after something a bit more chilled, that still has a distinctive edge to it.

That being said, when you arrive in Dublin, they will stamp your passport with a transit visa that will give you about 12 hours in Ireland, so you have enough time to make it across the border. You're right in saying there's no border police between the two but you want to be right, just in case. When leaving the country, they'll check how long you've been in for. If less than 6 months, you don't have to do a thing. If more, they'll check if you had a UK visa for the time you were there for.

false,Firefox7275,null,null,"**Name of product:** Superdrug Vitamin E Hot Cloth Cleanser

**Price of product:** £5 for 200ml (includes muslin cloth)

**Where did you purchase:** Superdrug

**Product claims:** *""Vitamin E Hot Cloth Cleanser with muslin cloth is ideal for removing dirt and make-up whilst providing gentle exfoliation. This will help improve circulation, leaving skin deeply cleansed, soft and radiant. Enriched with naturally sourced Vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant that will help to shield your skin against environmental damage and premature skin ageing by combating the harmful effects of free radicals. The rich and creamy formula also contains a skin conditioning multivitamin complex comprising vitamins A, B, F and H, which combined with horse chestnut extract, helps to care for dry skin.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. **ETA** I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I found a study suggesting [vitamin E can penetrate the skin from rinse off products.] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15608499)

Note that I was previously using a muslin cloth with a light lotion cleanser.  

**Your opinion:** I LOVE this cleanser and will repurchase especially for winter use. The thick texture and light feminine fragrance make it feel very luxurious, I haven't experienced any irritation or adverse reaction even used on irritated skin after microneedling. The cleanser leaves my skin silky soft but rinses away without excess residue. Will remove waterproof mascara, but have to rinse and repeat to feel really clean.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, caprylic/ capric triglycerides, cocoa butter, cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, polysorbate 60, sorbitan stearate, cetyl alcohol, propylene glycol, sweet almond oil, fragrance, vitamin E, panthenol, alcohol denat, PEG-35 castor oil, polysorbate 20, horse chestnut seed extract, retinyl palmitate, inositol (B3), vitamin B5, linoleic acid, biotin, potassium hydroxide, disodium EDTA, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, ethylparaben, butylparaben, propylparaben, isobutylparaben, citric acid.""*

Tested with universal indicator paper at pH 5/ 6.

Ignoring the whole abortion argument stuff, because that's sort of missing the point, it just seems really absurd how something the size of the moon exploding could result in anything other than the complete destruction of humankind. Sure, it didn't, but they had no way of knowing that. 

The only possible explanation is that the Doctor knew it wouldn't destroy humanity and Clara knew enough about the Doctor to guess he had some reason to believe that and that he wouldn't genuinely leave humanity at such risk. It had to be some absurd trust test, which Clara figured out and made her angry at the Doctor for playing with her life like that. Actually, now that I think about it, that makes a lot of sense and if made clearer would make this a far better episode.

Anyway, back to the point, reviews are not all so ambiguously positive.

Below are the reviews on IMDB. The rating for the episode was 9.7 last night and has been steadily decreasing since.

false,Firefox7275,null,null,"**Name of product:** Superdrug Naturally Radiant Hot Cloth Cleanser

**Price of product:** £3 for 150ml (includes muslin cloth)

**Where did you purchase:** Superdrug on half price offer

**Product claims:** *""Superdrug Naturally Radiant Brightening Hot Cloth Cleanser is formulated with a unique energising complex and infused with kiwi fruit and mulberry extracts to help revive skin's radiance and even out skin tone.*

*Enriched with nourishing cocoa butter, this rich and creamy formulation melts into the skin and cleanses away make-up and impurities, whilst also providing gentle exfoliation, leaving skin feeling renewed, soft and ultra clean.*

*Infused with plant extracts:*

- *Kiwi fruit extract is a rich source of vitamin C, which is renowned for its remarkable ability to help brighten and even out skin tone, while also providing antioxidant protection against free radicals.*

- *Mulberry fruit extract has naturally strong brightening properties which can help to reduce discolouration and even out skin tone.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. **ETA** I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I wanted a comparison to the Superdrug Vitamin E hot cloth cleanser. 

Note that I was previously using a muslin cloth with a light lotion cleanser.

**Your opinion:** I used this cleanser just four times over two weeks before returning it for a (hassle free no receipt) store refund. I hated the strong medicated scent and felt the product was irritating my skin. I had little bumps on my cheeks that vanished as soon as I stopped using it.

Comparing the ingredients to another hot cloth cleanser and another product from the Naturally Radiant line, it's the fragrance that is new to me not the plant or oil extracts. Other than that the ingredients are great for the price, no cheap mineral oil or petrolatum. This thick cleanser left my skin silky soft but wiped away without greasy residue. This product would likely be fine for someone with less sensitive skin than mine.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, caprylic/ capric triglycerides, cocoa butter, cetearyl alcohol, glycerin, polysorbate 60, sorbitan stearate, cetyl alcohol, propylene glycol, sweet almond oil, betaine, lotus flower extract, kiwi fruit extract, bilberry fruit extract, sugarcane extract, orange fruit extract, lemon fruit extract, sugar maple extract, mulberry leaf extract, soap berry extract, Caesalpinia spinosa gum, lecithin, vitamin E, ascorbyl palmitate, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexylglycerin, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, disodium EDTA, potassium hydroxide, citric acid.""*

Ade is our oldest player who still gets regular starts and he's been with us for a relatively long time. Same could be said of Dembele when we field a lot of 20-23 year olds consistently, making him look old. Once again for Lennon.

I highly doubt it myself that it's Lennon. Every time he's on the pitch, he gives everything he has even though he very well knows he's subbed on not to score goals but to help defend and draw out the game. It shows that he plays for the club and not for himself, which in my opinion, makes up for his ""lack of ability"". The Lennon guess was mostly a long shot.

Now that I mention it, Vertonghen fits the criteria as well. Though I highly doubt it if you can put your money on ITKs.

**Price of product:** £4.50 for 150ml

**Where did you purchase:** Boots using a £5 No.7 voucher

**Product claims:** *""Treat dry to very dry skin to this clever No.7 Beautiful Skin Cleansing Balm that cleanses, comforts and hydrates in one. It dissolves make-up and impurities while No.7’s unique multivitamin and mineral blend protects and replenishes the skin’s moisture levels.*

*The cleansing balm also safeguards skin against the drying effects of water – simply massage over the face and neck and wipe off with cotton wool – and the unique blend of lipids nourishes and nurtures for a perfectly clean and moisturised complexion in just one step.*

*“Enriched with No.7’s unique multivitamin and mineral blend to help hydrate and energise, plus a blend of replenishing lipids to help nourish dry skin and lock in moisture.” Dr Mike Bell, Boots Scientific skincare advisor.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. **ETA** I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I had a voucher and because the ingredients read like a dupe for CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (ceramides, cholesterol, phytosphingosine). 

Note that I was already using a muslin cloth with a light lotion cleanser. 

**Your opinion:** Ingredients and texture wise this is far more like a rich cream cleanser/ hair conditioner (!) than a greasy balm hence including in this category. This cleansing balm rinses completely clean with just water tho I choose to use a muslin cloth. It is barely scented and haven't experienced any irritation or adverse reaction even used on irritated skin after microneedling, but I definitely need to follow quite quickly with a serum or moisturiser or my skin tightens up a little.

IMO this is suitable for any skin type that would benefit from barrier repair, it is not rich enough for very dry skin. I might repurchase for summer use with a voucher but not at full price - £9.50 - since CeraVe Hydrating Cleaner is over twice the size for only 50% more. Not yet tested on waterproof mascara, I will update when I have.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, myristyl myristate, cocoa seed butter, tribehenin, butylene glycol, cetearyl olivate, sorbitan olivate, phenoxyethanol, vitamin E, methylparaben, fragrance, ethylparaben, sodium PCA, sodium lauroyl lactylate, acrylates/ C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, tetrasodium EDTA, ascorbyl glucoside, potassium hydroxide, dipropylene glycol, magnesium PCA, zinc PCA, biosaccharide gum-1, ceramide 3, cholesterol, ceramide 6 II, phytosphingosine, carbomer, manganese PCA, xanthan gum, propylparaben, potassium sorbate, ceramide 1.""*

**Product claims:** ""Our ultra-soothing formula is rich in antioxidant Vitamin E and contains Sunflower Oil to moisturize and nourish skin. An aromatherapy blend of essential oils boosts body, mind &amp; mood. Breathe deeply for best results. Promotes Stress Relief. Not tested on animals.""

**About you:** I use this oil for OCM. I have dry skin and acne issues. Patch test was brilliant so I've been using it on my face for months. I apply and wipe off with a witch hazel wipe. My face is not sensitive to the high amount of fragrance in this product.

**Your opinion:** I might re-buy this product. I use OCM sporadically, and the bottle will last me a long time. Someone using OCM every day might feel ripped off. My face isn't sensitive to the heavy fragrance in this product so I thoroughly enjoy putting it on my face. The bottle is a screw top and the opening for the bottle is a hole in the glass. It can be messy if you wanted to add more oil to your face after your hands get oily.

&gt;The __Sheep Heid Inn__ is a [public house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_house) in [Duddingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duddingston), [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh), [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland). There has reputedly been a pub on this spot selling liquor and victuals since 1360. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] If this foundation date was proved correct it would make The Sheep Heid Inn perhaps the oldest surviving licensed premises in Edinburgh, if not Scotland.

Although, I think she's more upset that he left her without warning, when the previous Doctor wouldn't so callously toss a unique newborn's fate away to someone else like that. I think it was more shock and missing Eleven by her side that did it to her, rather than the decision itself. That's just my opinion, though. One interpretation among many.

Besides, he took the tardis with him, leaving her to either kill herself, a fifteen year old, an innocent baby, a woman she just met, and blow up the moon, or save it and still have the moon crack into pieces, in which case she and the others would die anyway.

Which means, from her perspective, he basically left her to not only make the biggest decision of her life, but to die, either way, without so much as a by-your-leave. If someone you trusted, someone you thought was a friend, just left you to die like that, wouldn't you be just the tiniest bit angry?

false,BeneathTheWords,null,null,"Agreed. Regarding Clara getting upset: I think a lot of people forget (especially with this season with the Capaldi-hype) that even though The Doctor is being portrayed by a new actor, he's still the same PERSON on the show. Clara's right to get upset at The Doctor is completely justified if you spent most of your time on the TARDIS with 11, who made all the decisions for her, kept her safe all of the time (for the most part!), and never patronized her. To know that that same person is now doing things completely opposite of what she's used to, I think she has room to be upset. Leaving and not knowing if he's coming back, telling humans they're not special, not ""protecting"" the planet he claimed over and over and over was protected, etc.

I did rather enjoy this episode because it allowed me make a connection with characters again. (I remember specifically: When The Doctor is leaving the humans to make a decision and that tear falls from Clara's eye.) I remember watching this and saying ""Finally! Character development"" because I haven't even noticed Clara was there until this season. Things were too focused on Matt's departure and the Impossible Girl arc that they had to tie up loose ends started by other characters, which left no time for the current ones. Clara's story was already written for her and made up, and it was almost like Moffat said ""Okay...we already don't know who she is, so we have to find THAT out first before we can tell you who she REALLY is! (aka character development)

I think I put this theme above all else when I watch a TV show, personally. 

Why didn't I get upset when 9 regenerated into 10? (Honestly, it was spoiled for myself and I knew it was coming buuuut...) Because that's who The Doctor IS, we know that he's going to do that from past series. All of the NuWho first season was focused on who *Rose* was and how she was as a person and companion to The Doctor. So when she left, I was more upset then than I was when 9 regenerated. 

Same with 10, I connected with him over 3+ seasons and then he has an entire 2 part story to say goodbye? Of course I'm going to be a bit emotional. I also loved River's interaction into the story as well because her part was interesting and SLOW. It gave me time to think about who she was in The Doctor's life and to be the only person to do, and know, certain things about him means that she has to be someone very special.

I'm sure I forgot a few things, but you get the point. 


**TL;DR:** I think character development &gt; a current episode's stand-alone story. Especially this season because it's been so sparse over that last few.

Whenever there's a point in time that's in flux where humanity's future is shaped, the Doctor has to take a step back. The Doctor can't be the one to shape it. He can help us not die, but he can't define who we are as a people. Think back to Cold Blood/The Hungry Earth. The Doctor can't be the one to say ""alright, humans and Silurians have to live together and here's how"" because he really has no right to make that decision. He's a protector, not director. He can step in to help enact the plan once the decision is made, but he can't make the that decision, because it shapes who humankind is for the future. We just haven't been shown many of these instances because they don't always make for good television. It's better to have the Doctor fight against a threat he can defeat than grapple with a moral choice he isn't allowed to make.

It’s only 35 years in the future and that astronaut woman looks like she’s pushing 50 at least

&gt;1300000000 tons 

That’s would add less than a millionth of 1% to the moon’s overall mass 

What were they planning to do with those nukes before they knew what the problem was, You can’t destroy the moon with just 1000 nukes?

If the moons mass had increased so much that it now has earth gravity why hasn’t it’s orbit changed?

&gt;we’d stopped going into space 

But there was a Mexican base on the moon already. Everyone stopped going into space except the Mexicans? If so why didn’t send a rescue mission for their own people?  
&gt;this isn’t water it’s amniotic fluid 

amniotic fluid is mostly made of water 

even if the creature is maturing it can’t be increasing in mass unless there’s an input of matter from somewhere else


I know Doctor Who science is often silly and out of step with reality but honestly this stuff all just so basic I can’t let it go. Seriously they might as well have said the moon was cheese

Sorry if that is politically inconvenient for you, but think about it. It was a good idea to sell occupied social housing that was 'off the market' in order to have self-funding new social housing.

It wasn't a conservative idea but it is exactly the kind of idea that would be regarded as Conservative in other circumstances. The taxpayer doesn't have to find new social housing, the housing market could fund new social housing.

It was a conservative council in the 70s who first trialled this, sell social housing to the existing occupants who can afford to buy, use the proceeds to build new housing, which is why it was adopted by the Conservative party before the 79 election.

Meat at the markets may or may not be cheaper, but vegetables and fruit will almost definitely be.

Other money saving tips: Cashback is your friend. Many stores have loyalty card programmes that will give you points for future purchases; I reckon that I get about one free grocery shop every two months or so thanks to my Nectar card.

1. We've just come out of 4 very difficult away fixtures - we didn't lose the derby and we're on track to qualify in Europe.

2. Man Utd's squad is worthy of European and domestic success at every level. We've just given a very good account of ourselves after a 4,000 mile round trip to Russia. This is not a loss to get worried about.

3. We've shored up our defences. Sure we haven't had a clean sheet in a while but we're not conceding left right and centre like we were at the start of the season. The 2 goals we conceded today I don't feel bad about.

4. We're scoring goals. League Cup match aside, we've score in every fixture. Even when we've played poorly we have been scoring goals. This is much better than the Moyes days of 3-4 games without a goal.

5. Our next 5 league games are very winnable and apart from City, we've already played all the teams who finished above us last season.

6. We have some promising prospects. Stones is maturing, Besic looks a steal at £4m and McGeady and Oviedo and are finally getting some game time. Something they didn't get a whole lot of last year.

Now, not everything is positive, here are the negatives.

1. Lukaku doesn't look like a £28m striker. He's losing the ball and looks lethargic. I personally think he hasn't recovered from the World Cup. Please give him time and judge him on his goals. Think he had one chance that he completely fashioned himself today. Once the service comes, the goals will come.

2. Injuries are hurting us. Coleman, Mirallas, Barkley, McCarthy, possibly Stones now by the looks of things. I would challenge anyone to post their favoured starting XI here and I bet Martinez hasn't had a chance to play it yet due to injuries.

3. We've dropped silly points. I'm talking about Leicester, Arsenal and Crystal Palace. These have all hurt us.

Anyone who was a fan throughout the whole Moyes era knows that extra games and European football hurts a squad like Everton. We don't have a bottomless pit of talent and league form will suffer. We can't expect to go to places like Anfield and Old Trafford and come away with 3 points everytime.

All I'm saying is, don't lose your cool. Come the end of November and we're still in the bottom half then by all means hit the panic button. Right now though I am thoroughly enjoying our European exploits, but take into account that league form WILL suffer.

Besic and Gibbo for me (If Macca is still out) against Villa. We need Seamus back now because he's been desperately missed. Pienaar looked injured again so I'd go with Oviedo on the left because he looked quite good after coming on maybe a bit rusty.

 I'll probably get downvotes from all the americans who barely know the sport for this but Howard needs to cop the fuck on or fuck off. 21 goals in 10 games I believe now isn't it? It's been him Jags and Distin at fault for the majority and Jags has regained some form. It was Howard's fault for not clearing correctly for their second goal. I said in another discussion we need a new keeper in January or next season and I'd say that young Butland lad from Stoke would be a great option. Looks to be future England No.1 and wouldn't be too expensive given his age and potential. I would've also liked Forester before he went to Southampton but I guess that's football for you.

Rom is another who needs to improve a lot. He's barely better than a Sunday League lad who's straight out the pub in most games. He's been shockingly bad in most every game and yet he's still easily starting. Bobby needs to show him and every other player in the team that if you're not playing well or even playing like a fucking professional footballer then you're not in the team simple as that. Just think of other teams in the league and what they've paid for their main strikers and their form. I mean Chelsea paid £4m more for Costa?

2. Earth is in impending death because of the Moon and the waters are rising. If the Moon is destroyed then problems would only get worse. Even so, let's say they ignore the fact Earth would be rumbled by no Moon, they send a suicide squad with a space shuttle from a museum and just works with a few touch-ups?! I mean... What?!

A massive tidal wave would come up and other m'larky. But no. Nothing. Not to mention for something that caused gravity on the Moon, Earth isn't pulled by this mass when it flys away.

A project will also be set up in Alan's name, eventually to benefit those that Alan died trying to help in Syria to ensure his legacy continues long after he was taken from us.""

**Price of product:** ~£1 for 200ml

**Where did you purchase:** Bodycare (no longer stocked at my local branch)

**Product claims:** *""Our deep cleansing milk with sweet almond oil has been specially formulated to cleanse and moisturise the skin whilst gently removing dirt and oils leaving your skin feeling clean and soft. Paraben free, pH balanced, allergen free. This product has not been tested on animals.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. Re-purchased multiple times over three years but initially selected when the recession started to bite!

**Your opinion:** This is a no-frills cleanser with a very faint 'baby powder' scent and lightweight lotion texture. I haven't experienced any adverse reaction even on irritated skin after microneedling or light AHA peels. It easily removes everyday make up but not waterproof mascara.

**Ingredients:** *""Water, sweet almond oil, glyceryl stearate, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, PEG-100 stearate, cocoamidopropyl PG-dimonium chloride phosphate, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, fragrance, disodium EDTA.""*

It cannot be too hard, I mean Cameron has benefited from printing money in the first place but if he cant be bothered to do that why not a television appeal during xfactor, phone in and donate? save the life of a decent Brit? 
The French government were paying the ransoms behind the scenes. Cameron had the power to save these men. 


Edit. for those downvoting because it sets a precedent? thats short shrift for those people that got their head's cut off slowly with a small knife and does not take into account that our nearest neighbour France is paying the ransom too.
We should not fear paying them, we should just make sure that no other naive British good samaritans go over there. The money is useless to them when they end up getting blown to pieces by a giant laser guided paveway anyway.
Long term, there is no decent reasoning to not pay the ransom and save these British Nationals. ISIS cannot get a hold of decent anti air and they will be dead long term anyway. Take the French option it is already a much more successful precedent. I bet anyone in here downvoting if they were awaiting beheading would quickly change their minds.


I really find most of your responses to be quite shocking really that you lack both the humanity,wit, foresight coupled with a general lack of imagination to even begin to comprehend a package of measures that can maximize the survival rates of our fellow Britons whilst we decrease the value longterm of any mere ransom money paid to these lunatics.
The French government take this stance and have shown that so far they have been successful in saving their citizens whilst prosecuting war against ISIS, if the name of the game is protecting your own nationals whilst degrading ISIS than we are failing miserably and they are succeeding fantastically.",0,1412516714,null,0,1412530999,0,cl0ywp8,t3_2icihe,t1_cl0ywp8,t3_2icihe,null,1426675188,-24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-24

There is schemes to motivate and fund BMX for these talented riders, but they're hard to come by - which they need to be, otherwise everybody would be getting sponsored for it, because their is too much talent these days, so they only pick the best. The kid in the yellow (Owen Page) is pretty talented *but* there are better kids his age, which is why he hasn't been sponsored or anything yet.

The only thing which keeps these kids riding is the satisfaction of learning new things, progressing and also having fun with their friends. It's the fun which matters most though. Encouraging them to be competitive and constantly want to beat others isn't fun. BMX is a sport where you can do what you want. No rules, no limits. The competitive side is what's ruined it in my opinion. People should do things for fun, not to be better than others. Getting paid should just be a bonus to it.

**Price of product:** £10 for 200ml

**Where did you purchase:** The Body Shop (~~free sample~~) on BOGOHP offer

**Product claims:** *""This silky-soft cleanser will effortlessly remove make-up from the whole face quickly and effectively, leaving skin feeling clean, refreshed and clear of impurities. It’s the ultimate time-saver.*

* *Removes make-up*

* *Suitable for sensitive skin and contact lens wearers*

* *Removes waterproof make-up*

* *Leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Sample initially requested because I have never used an oil cleanser before, but I have now purchased the full size.

**Your opinion:** The price is very reasonable considering the largely natural base - no water or mineral oil which are both super cheap ingredients - and the pack size which is larger than the NSPA cleansers. Has a sweet yet earthy scent. The pump bottle dispenses the right amount for the face, a second pump covers neck and decollete.

This cleansing oil obviously goes on somewhat greasy which I am not accustomed to, but will likely adjust to that. I haven't experienced any irritation or adverse reaction and it rinses clean with warm water so IMO is suitable for all skin types. Easily dissolves waterproof mascara.

Since purchasing the full size I have noticed the pores on my nose are virtually invisible right after cleansing, that doesn't usually occur until after moisturising! This oil is fast becoming a staple in my routine and I'm poised to purchase another cleansing oil as a comparison.

**Ingredients:** *""Soybean oil, sweet almond oil, sunflower seed oil, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, caprylic/ capric triglyceride, ethylhexyl palmitate, isohexadecane, polysorbate 85, sorbitan trioleate, sesame seed oil, octyldodecanol, fragrance, linalool, tocopherol, limonene, Roman chamomile flower oil, citric acid.""*

When Seven fucked with Ace's head and then justified himself later, I could believe that Seven cared about her and honestly wanted to see her get better.   He had the wise old grandpa thing going.  But Twelve just seems like a manipulative control freak who's getting off on the power trip of showing off for lesser lifeforms.

And it's not like this is an isolated incident.  The way the Doctor behaved towards her and Danny in the previous ep was totally inexcusable, especially the whole PE thing.  He was acting like a controlling bully then, and he goes and does it again.

And then there was the ep where he was so arrogant he nearly committed permanent suicide because he refused to listen to Clara...

Unless I'm misremembering, the Doctor hasn't had a companion tell him off and then leave in tears since Teegan blew up at Five.  And I honestly don't think a Doctor has deserved a chewing out more, ever.   I love Capaldi and what he's trying to do with the role, but frankly, I think the writers are *ruining* the Doctor this season.

* The science is ridiculously bad. Yes, it's sci-fi about a time traveler in a police call box that is larger on the inside and can travel anywhere in time and space, so some hand-waving is certainly allowed (suspended disbelief). However this episode screwed up a bunch of very, very basic science, essentially needlessly, destroying the suspended disbelief of a good chunk of us.
* Terrible character reactions. ""I'm on the moon in the future and have just nearly been killed! I'm sooo bored"". Oh, and let me just wander off here on the moon, completely alone, for no reason.
* Unnecessary plot elements, that were neither needed, explained, or of consequence. Spiders. How did they get there? What purpose did they serve in the plot, other than to kill off a couple of mentally challenged 'characters' that were brought onscreen for 30 seconds before they died? ""You're taking pictures of me to post online? Absolutely unacceptable. But I'm not going to bother you about them later when we get together again.""

b) Re: buying tickets. Hard to give an easy answer. You could get two Light Memberships (£27 each) and try to get a pair when they go on sale in November. Alternatively, wait for the handful of tickets that go on general sale nearer the day - it'll save you the membership fees but it's much riskier.  The other option is to try the RAWK ticket exchange but that won't be open until much closer to the fixture. 

c) For things to do: Liverpool One for shopping. Tate Modern for art. Beatles Tour/Beatles Museum if you like The Beatles. LFC Stadium tour. Loads of great pubs. The cathedrals. The docks. The Three Graces. Plus Manchester and Chester are both less than an hour on the train. If you don't mind renting a car, you've also got the Lake District and North Wales a comfortable drive away. You're also not far from Cheshire's triumvirate of boring museums: the hat museum in Stockport, Macclesfield's silk museum and Northwich's salt museum.

d) Wear what you want at the match. Though it may seem *de rigueur*, don't feel like you have to strap a GoPro to your head or get something painfully unfunny on the back of your shirt. Top Reds like me just go in their normal clothes but wear a Liverpool top if you want. There is some etiquette though: don't boo the team, even if we're shit.

&gt;In [Norse mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology), __Heimdallr__ is a [god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86sir) who possesses the resounding horn [Gjallarhorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjallarhorn), owns the golden-maned horse [Gulltoppr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulltoppr), has gold teeth, and is the son of [Nine Mothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Mothers_of_Heimdallr). Heimdallr is attested as possessing foreknowledge, keen eyesight and hearing, is described as ""the whitest of the gods"", and keeps watch for the onset of [Ragnarök](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k) while drinking fine [mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead) in his dwelling [Himinbjörg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himinbj%C3%B6rg), located where the burning rainbow bridge [Bifröst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifr%C3%B6st) meets heaven. Heimdallr is said to be the originator of [social classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class) among humanity and once regained Freyja's treasured possession [Brísingamen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%ADsingamen) while doing battle in the shape of a [seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped) with [Loki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki). Heimdallr and Loki are foretold to kill one another during the events of Ragnarök. Heimdallr is additionally referred to as __Rig__, __Hallinskiði__, __Gullintanni__, and __Vindlér__ or __Vindhlér__.

Rather, it just reflects the change in the Doctor's behavior.

He didn't rely on Amy nor the others to make a decision.

This time around, The Doctor also knew what the right choice was, but let the humans decide for themselves. To see whether this time, they would make the right choice or not. By shutting the nukes, Clara proved to the Doctor that there are humans who aren't pudding-brain, and are willing to risk the consequences around such moral dilemmas.


I understand Clara's reaction. She's angry at how the Doctor just abandoned them to make the decision. She's angry at the fact that they nearly made the wrong decision, and that the Doctor was wrong to treat this as a problem for humans alone. Of course, she'd have been this angry even if they nuked the alien, but this time over taking an innocent being's life. 

I guess this is a culmination of Clara's frustration about not being able to identify with the new Doctor, furthering the plot point which would pave the way for her exit.

 It's more like your given some money to buy a kid some food that will make him full, so you think ""if I give him ice cream he'll have a wonderful time and also get full! ""

 You also have 29 other children in your class who do not need to get full from eating ice cream, infact if you try and give them the same ice cream they will get really bored because they already had that ice cream and don't need it anymore. BUT those kids are really thirsty!  You don't have any money to buy these kids lenonade while the other kids are having ice cream so instead you work until 11:30 at night hand crafting strawberry juice (because that's their favourite) and making little cups with each kids name on it so that they'll have the best time ever quenching that thirst!  (Don't get me onto what will happen if you don't make sure that they are drinking enough! Also the kids who are having ice cream today have to eventually get to the point where they need to have something to drink..but they won't be ready for another couple of months). Point being,  I think you may be over simplifying a rather complex point.

But also,  please don't give your kid ice cream and smarties for dinner even if that's what they say they want. . I really shouldn't have to point that out ;)

IT ALL started to go wrong while we were filming on a mountain in the world’ southernmost ski resort, just outside the city of Ushuaia in Tierra del Fuego.

We knew Ushuaia was the port from which the General Belgrano had sailed on its doomed voyage at the start of the Falklands War and we knew that anti-British feelings still run hard and deep, here at the bottom of the world.
As a result we were on our best behaviour. We were posing for all photographs, and happily accepting requests for autographs. The sun was out. All was calm. We were even referring to the slopes as “radients” Certainly there was no suggestion that we had walked into the middle of a war we thought had ended 32 years ago.

But then came word from the bottom of the mountain. Some protesters had arrived and were keen to let everyone know they were unhappy with our visit. Our producers tried to explain that we were there to film at the ski resort and then to host a game of car football in the city. England v Argentina. The Bottom of the World Cup we were going to call it.

They were not listening. They were angry. They said that they were not violent but that a group of men from the local truckers’rade union were on their way. And that when they arrived things would definitely turn nasty. Our local fixers advised that we stop filming immediately, leave the cars on the gradients and go to a nearby hotel.
“his is a mafia state,”aid one onlooker. “est you do as you’e told.”

So we did, but going to the hotel did not work. A gang of people were waiting there. They said they were war veterans, which seemed unlikely as most were in their twenties and thirties. Bonnets were banged. Abuse was hurled. The police arrived and immediately breathalysed Andy Wilman, our executive producer —e’e not sure why.
Richard Hammond, James May and I bravely hid under the beds in a researcher’ room while protesters went through the hotel looking for us. The car park was filling up. More were arriving. This was starting to get ugly.
Back at home, newspapers were saying I had caused the problem by arriving in this political tinderbox in a Porsche bearing the numberplate H982FKL, which if you turned the H into a 1 and transposed the K and the L, could have been seen as a reference to the 1982 Falklands War.

This, however, was untrue. The car had indeed arrived in Argentina with those plates, but two days into our journey, when we were in Chile, a Twitter user pointed out the problem so we removed them.
When we arrived in Tierra del Fuego the car had no plate at all on the front and a meaningless jumble of letters and numbers on the back. And no, it wasn’ W3WON. Which it would have been if I’ been trying to ruffle feathers.
The numberplate then wasn’ the issue. But something was causing more and more people to arrive at the hotel. Twitter was rammed with messages from locals saying they wanted blood. One said they were going to barbecue us and eat the meat.

“urn them. Burn their cars,”aid another. Mob rule was in the driving seat.
Government officials then stepped in saying we were no longer welcome in the city, that our safety could not be guaranteed and that we needed to leave Argentina immediately. Plainly they had given us permission to visit simply so they could make political capital from ejecting us when we arrived.
The problem was: how do you leave when the streets are filled with mobs with pickaxe handles, paving stones and bricks? No one had an answer to that one.

Chile is a spit away across the Beagle Channel but we weren’ allowed to cross it because Argentina says it owns the land on the other side, too. We therefore gathered up as many possessions as we could, rounded up the girls from our party and made a dash for the airport.

That night we were in Buenos Aires among sensible Argentinians who couldn’ believe what had happened. And the next morning we were back in Britain.

We felt that with us three gone the situation might calm down. It didn’.

We had left behind 29 people; cameramen, sound recordists, fixers, locals and producers. They had to make their escape overland in a ragtag collection of hired 4x4s, trucks and the three “tar”ars that they had been told to remove from the ski resort.

They faced a long, bumpy and gruelling six-hour trek to the Chilean border and safety. But in the first town the locals were ready. A lorry was blocking the road and as our convoy approached, it reversed at speed towards them, forcing our guys onto the verges, which were filled with people who made it plain they wanted blood. Bricks were hurled, windscreens were smashed and two of the party were cut by flying glass. But they made it through.
And then they had a problem. The next city was Rio Grande. And the word from there was that 300 cars and thousands of locals were setting up an ambush. This turned out to be true.

The British embassies in Chile and Argentina were doing their best to get a police escort. And the nine of us who had escaped were in a hotel room in Buenos Aires working through the night to find a plane and an airfield from which they could get out because, make no mistake, lives were at stake.

Meanwhile, a chase had begun. Our guys were being herded towards the ambush.
So they abandoned the star cars, which were filled with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of camera equipment —nd my new hat —t the side of the road. And took off across the frozen wilderness to a remote border post where there isn’ even a road. You get into Chile by fording a river.

We had to get a tractor there to pull them across. And it had to be a fast tractor because we knew our convoy was being chased by the thugs. And you try finding a fast tractor at 2am, in the middle of nowhere. All credit to producer Al Renton that he did it.

With the batteries dying in the convoy’ satellite phone, we lost contact and for six hours had no clue whether they had been caught. Whether our friends were alive or dead. That was a long night.
I still haven’ had a chance to speak to any of them but I know they were held at the Argentine border from 3am, when they arrived, until 11am. Why? To allow the thugs to catch up? Who knows? All I really care about is that they are now in Chile and safe.

Tierra del Fuego is not listed as a problem for visitors by the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office but there is no question in my mind that we walked into a trap.

I know mischievous newspapers in Britain have said it was all my fault because of the numberplate. But that wasn’ even mentioned down there because the plate in question had been replaced.

No. We were English (apart from one Aussie camera guy and a Scottish doctor) and that was a good enough reason for the state government to send 29 people into a night filled with rage and flying bricks.
“ook what we’e done,”hey will say at the next elections. “ent the English packing.”

That is true. We got our arses kicked. But there is a glimmer of a silver lining in the whole sorry affair. The game of football would have been a good ending for our Christmas special. But we’e been gifted something even better by the region’ politicians and their rent-a-mob cohorts.

I’ like to say “otcha”t this point. But I won’.

Argentinians denounce '200 years of lies'

Argentine officials and newspapers seized the opportunity of the row over Top Gear’ visit to bash the British in general and the BBC in particular. One official even used it to restate Argentina’ claim to the Falklands, write Clare Pennington and George Arbuthnott.

Jeremy Clarkson insisted he was unaware that his Porsche’ H982 FKL numberplate could be taken as an allusion to the 1982 conflict and had it removed as soon as he was alerted by Twitter protests.

But Mariano Plecity, the regional government minister in Tierra del Fuego where the incident happened, demanded a written apology from Clarkson and the Top Gear production team, stressing the importance to the region of the Malvinas, as the Falklands are known in Argentina.

“ou have to take into account that the Malvinas belong to Tierra del Fuego and the city of Ushuaia is the capital of the Malvinas,”e said. “he licence plate number on the car was a provocation and a very big offence in all of Tierra del Fuego.”

Plecity said the most important thing for the local government had been that Clarkson “eave without his life being threatened, because had he stayed longer, the response from society would have been much bigger”
Clarin, the top-selling newspaper in Argentina, rejected Clarkson’ explanation that the use of the numberplate had not been deliberate.

It quoted a member of the war veterans’ssociation as saying the British had a long-running habit of being dishonest.

“hey say that they did not want to hurt our feelings but they have been lying to us for 200 years,”aid Osvaldo Hilliar.

The strength of anti-British feeling in Tierra del Fuego is illustrated by the twinning earlier this year of Rio Grande, the province’ industrial capital, with Algeciras, a Spanish city near the British territory of Gibraltar, to which Spain has long maintained a claim.

Diario Popular, a Buenos Aires newspaper, said Top Gear had a record of offending foreign countries. It claimed Clarkson had “aunted Asians”ith a reference to a “lope”n a bridge in Burma, for which an apology was later made.
The Top Gear presenters also previously risked a riot by driving into redneck country in the Deep South of America with cars including a pick-up truck with the words “an-love rules OK”n it.",0,1412519533,null,0,false,0,cl0zsek,t3_2icpzg,t1_cl0zsek,t3_2icpzg,null,1426674708,51,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,51

You completely missed the point of the analogy anyway. The point isn't that the ice cream is more appropriate for one of the children, it's that from the child's perspective one is being given preferential treatment.  

Children don't understand or care about the concept of thought being put into something. Even when you're an adult it doesn't make the end product any less shitty, you just don't care how shitty it is because the gesture is more meaningful than a gift. Do you not understand that regardless of you putting together a lesson you think is fun and engaging for the kids not getting a trip they still feel like you've taken a shit on them by excluding them?

Dier is great in defense but, apart from that bizarre debut where he played a bit of center forward, is not the most attacking full back out there.  makes sense since, I think, he considers himself a center back.  Naughton, on the other hand, is a very good second-string right back, so his injury could be really damaging if he misses any games.

an interesting discussion would be, assuming both Walker and Naughton are missing and assuming Dier starts at RB, what would the contingency be for a Dier injury?  my first thought is to bring on Chiriches to play right back.  my second thought is to move Kaboul to RB and bring on Fazio/Chiriches/someone at CB to replace Kaboul.

my last thought, which is only tangentially related to the rest of this comment, is what would it be like if we one day had a back four of:

     Dier - Kaboul - Chiriches/Fazio - Vertonghen

basically all center backs.

Space Shuttle couldn't go to the Moon.

I could bear the sagginess of the astronaut clothes (yay, we surely will have invent a space suit in the near future which will not have to be pressurized), but they didn't even properly explained the mysterious added mass. There was no barely plausible excuse for violating the law of conservation of mass/energy... Btw even a hundred nuclear bombs wouldn't do much damage to the Moon.

Don't they know how to do a simple Google search for the mass of the Moon, so they can make up a more believable number for the mass of that creature? It was fucking huge, come on.

Yeah, right, by simply looking at the spider thingy from afar the Doctor can tell that they're prokaryotic... And there wasn't even any reason for them to be there, it was just pure plot device (even that deus ex machina piece of flying plate which closed the breach was better).

The creature moved, which sent the girl flying, yet strangely enough everything else remained at rest. *facepalm*

""if da mun breaks apart itll fall down, spooky"" - no it wouldn't, the Moon is fucking orbiting and the pieces of it would fucking orbit too, maybe in slightly different orbits, but still (unless the creature would throw them retrograde at high speeds). And WTF is with disintegration of the shell?

I could ignore the huge level of sciencey oversights (single cell bacteria, the non-efefcts of the moon being gone before the new egg was laid, gravity issues, laying of same size egg, crash landing a shuttle on the moon with nukes, there being no creature like it in the universe, the lights...), but the episode would've had to pick up the slack elsewhere.

The tumbler gag and the lines about regenerations were pretty funny (what was with the astronaut laughing about tumbler right after her friends died?), but I thought that when the spider attacked the first guy and the Doctor just yells run were another element to the 'darker doctor' conceit, especially when you consider that nobody runs away from him when he gets attacked by one.

Also, might it have been possible that, however hazy the outcome, the Doctor at that point may have known or found out that Clara would make the right choice? He did pop off in the TARDIS for a while...And if this was what Clara was thinking, it would explain her decision to go against the 'vote.'

That said, Coleman and Capaldi's acting really carried things, and this episode continues to pack so many little references and quips in that it's worth a rewatch for those two points alone. Not a fan of Courtney either, or the Earth-centric focus of the season.

9 Was the Griever, he was still processing his actions as the War doctor and he was my favorite before 12. The giddiness mixed with a deep sadness and the spine to make the hard choices. 

10 was the Atoner. He had worked past much of 9's self recriminations and took on the burden of being the *only* Time Lord, while finding his love of exploration again. ""I made this mess I have to clean it up.. Oooo a squirrel!"" 

11 was the Unburdened. He's gotten over his angst and the darkness of his choices and put them behind him, he's got a girl, a family. He's *happy* probably for the first time in centuries. 

And then it all gets snatched away, and he has to put on his big boy pants, fix his tie and remember that he's the gods' damned Doctor. 

Capeldi's doctor is bitter. He's older, he's back to being a bit jaded. He's stopped showing his affection for people and hides it behind a wall of snark. He's distancing himself, because he knows he *can't* be the ""boyfriend"" anymore. 

He's the doctor. 

Danny's pegged him, and 12 is a bit miffed about it. He *IS* pushing Clara. He's teaching her the hard way, to make the hard choices. He's not angsting about protecting people from *THEIR* choices anymore. 

""You lot, with the hair and the terrible fashion sense. you made this bed. You didn't get pounced on by some greedy space goblin, or get mind screwed into dancing the remigold in a tacky dress. I'm not protecting you *from yourselves* anymore, it's time for humanity to put on it's big girl pants.""  

I wanted to smack the shit out of Clara for her rant. I get that she's venting, that she nearly made the wrong choice and she's lashing at the doctor when she should be lashing at herself. That Danny refused to answer if he was wrong made me like mickey 2.0 all the more.

She sat down. WTF?

Then when she saw the bus coming she nearly ran because she thought he was going to stop on the right hand side of the shelter and tried to get past everyone. Then when the bus stopped on the left hand side, she walked back again past everyone else who has been there long before her. I hate old people like that.

false,IanCal,null,null,"&gt; What about stocks and shares? How risky are they? And how would I start investing in them?

Shares of individual companies are pretty risky, but index funds are less so (they're basically ways of investing in several hundred or thousand companies all at once, spreading the risk). Over long time periods, they perform pretty reliably (it's the type of thing your pension will be invested in, to a large degree). However, over a year or a few years they can drop in value by 30% quite easily (like in 2007 with the crash). Of course, as long as you don't sell and wait for things to rise again you won't have actually lost any money but you need to actually follow that (and it can be difficult to do so).

&gt; And how would I start investing in them?

This part is fairly easy, you open a stocks and shares isa (there are many providers, these are one : http://www.hl.co.uk/ )

Then you put some money in, and then choose some funds to invest in. This point is technically easy but there's a lot of jargon to wade through. Overall you want to find something that invests broadly and has low fees, so things like this are pretty reasonable:

http://www.hl.co.uk/funds/fund-discounts,-prices--and--factsheets/search-results/v/vanguard-lifestrategy-80-equity-accumulation

There can be minimum amounts to invest, this one has a £50/month minimum.

He wasn't always that way, and he's always talked down to his companions. Now he's a man who's brave enough to face all that he has done and all the bad things that are out there in the world, and because of this he has a harder time connecting to the humans he loves. As for Clara, I feel like the biggest problem people have with her is she isn't fawning all over the Doctor like Amy, Martha, and Rose did. If anything, she's just a younger and less crass version of Donna. She won't take his crap, will make her feelings known, and has no qualms with putting him in his place. As for Danny, he's nothing like Micky or Rory, he's a soldier, the representation of everything the Doctor despises in humanity and so there's conflict. They're probably going to connect once the Doctor realizes that Danny had foregone being a soldier for the same reasons the Doctor doesn't like them. I think it's a nice, complex look at a side of him we have only gotten peeks at over the past few years.

Some thoughts on individuals:

Capoue was a beast as per usual. His range of passing is immense

Mason again did not look out of place, he made a couple of mistakes but worked hard and really seems to be a prem level player. Excellent, quick, simple, distribution.

Speaking of distribution Lloris's was better than usual today, had a couple of neuer-esque clearances that could've put ade through on goal.

Ade still not great, needless offsides, poor touches.

Eriksen had an excellent match, goal thoroughly deserved. Hopefully he's hitting his stride.

Kaboul had another great match, he's like a totally different player. Cemented his place at least for now.

No, that's not how it works.  On the other side of the Earth there would have also been a high tide as well.

The side facing the moon because the water is being pulled away from the Earth, and on the other side, essentially because the Earth is being pulled away from the water.

Didn't you ever wonder why there are two high tides in a day and not just one as it would be if your model were right?

Like I said, the low tides are on the perpendicular plane.

Forster had his first real test in goal, and to be honest looked a bit shaky. I counted three balls that he should've held onto.

Chadli was unlucky that that ball didn't go in, but I loved his play the whole time. Mason and Capoue could be the midfield pairing of the year. Defense played well, but I wanted to give a special shout to Rose who made any right sided attack by Soton utterly irrelevant. Hugo was Hugo. And Vert and Kaboul are clearly the pairing in back. Great discipline and all around game by both (minus Kaboul's clearance).

**The episode made no-fucking-sense.**

Pretty much the worst script with the worst cohesion since The Curse of the Black Spot (I really hate that mess of an episode where supporting characters disappear with no explanation and no one noticing... I thought it was the Silence, cool episode incoming, but then no, just poor writing).

Short list:

* No one ever goes to space anymore. Oh, that base? 10 years ago, and we didn't care until now, because fuck it!
* There's no astronauts, so we have to take old people, except a young woman who whatever. Don't mind our suits are awesome, but we had no time to build a goddamn spacecraft which can land properly. By the way, how did that ship arrive to the moon? They can't do that, they can't fly that long.
* Let's not bring weapons. Those recorded screams? Nah, pretty sure the moon is safe! Where the fuck are UNIT, Torchwood, and all the other alien-fighting organizations? And of course, let's send a ton of nukes. What could go wrong? It's not like some aliens in the moon could take them and deliver them back with the red light on.
* How did the mass of the moon-baby exactly grow? Where did the materials from that mass increase come from?
* How the hell did the moon-baby lay an egg the same size and the same mass the one it just came from?
* Spiders hate light oh no! 5-min later, they're running in the light. Because sense.
* Oh no the doctor jumped into that lake stuff cave of whatever. Will he be back? Yeah, just took 2min to go down there and come back. That's how you build an exciting narrative!
* Why do they land in the spaceship instead of, you know, the moon? And why the original crew doesn't give a damn? Well, we already lose so much time with supporting characters being confused about the doctor appearing, so let's skip that part! They sure aren't a menace, and they sure aren't behind what's going on here!
* Oh hai I'm the doctor I care about about life, and always make cool speeches to save stuff. Just changed my opinion, I'm leaving, cya! Kill it if you want, I don't care lol! So out of character.

Also, Chloe Webber vibe across the entire episode. I wanted to slap that stupid ass kid in the face across the entire episode. Anyway, does her tumblr really exist? That would be a nice twist.

Best part of the episode: Clara ragequitting. Yeah, go away, and don't be back. I already have enough overacting with Daenerys in Game of Thrones.

I just saw Kill the Moon, and it was like a condensed version of many of the elements of series 5-7 that I've disliked(which wound make sense as some people are claiming this particular episode was intended for Matt Smith). It didn't help matters that the creeping misanthropy and bitterness of Capaldi's Doctor(and I'm still going to blame the script or director for that, not Capaldi himself) was a major turn off for me.

I'm kind of surprised that the space whale wasn't from the Moon. While such a connection wouldn't have saved that episode (by that point it was beyond redemption), it definitely would have helped establish more consistency in the lore/timeline written by Moffat. 

Although to be fair Clara's character has become far more believable though, and the last 5-7 minutes of Kill the Moon are definitely reflective of that. This episode's final minutes and The Caretaker were just full of character development, which is a refreshing change.

Hibbert is doing very well, and he'll always give an honest performance. I've always thought if the game was about one-on-one defending and winning the ball, he'd be a world class player, but he has a tendency to get sucked in to the ball, leaving space in and around himself, and consequently; the penalty area. I think in that sense I can qualify it best by saying 6 is my average, like the newspapers used to do.

Also, I liked Pienaar's interchanges during the game and he probably stood out against McGeady due to his workrate, but Lukaku was bullied today by a defender playing his third top flight game, shows no desire to battle for the ball and most criminally when he does get it, makes no effort to burst into the penalty area which was a hallmark of his game last season.

I know I'm going on a bit here, but at the start of the second half, we played seven one-touch passes from Baines, Naismith and Pienaar, the last one hit a good-sized space in the penalty area, but Lukaku was lingering deep, a good thirty yards out for reasons best known to himself. At the moment, he's offering so little to the team I'm struggling to understand why Bobby keeps picking him, because it's to the detriment of performance.

Listen not answering questions was also intentional because the message was that it doesn't matter if there is a monster or not, it is okay to be afraid. Moffat is also intentionally leaving gaps to show that a lot of time is passing between the adventures so the character development makes more sense and there isn't really enough time in each story to explain everything. Moffat also likes to make room for future writers to fill in the gaps.

And there were a lot of fans who complained that Moffat's mysteries were too involved with day to day episodes so he scaled back the Promised Land arc so each episode could have more time to itself. Moffat can't really please everyone although it seems like this season he really tried to by giving Clara more character development (but now fans are upset) and scaling back the mysteries.

Basically I am just trying to point out that there are many different ways each of these stories have and can be made and some trends and situations are not new. If they don't really like the show is going right now, they can wait for future episodes or look to past episodes and audios.

It is okay to not like the new Doctor, it is okay not to like the way the new episodes are going. But it should be understood that the show cannot please everyone and that's okay. It should be understood that the resolutions to mysteries are almost never going to live up to expectations and that the show is going to repeat itself a lot. It is also difficult for the show to balance the routine episodes and the overarching mystery. One or the other is going to have to take a back seat for a while when each episode is only 40-45 minutes long (and if all we had were two-parters other fans would probably complain that the stories had too much fluff).

I concede that this may be the case. I'm arguing this whole abortion thing on a lot of different fronts, so I'm sorry if I can't give you as thorough a reply as you gave me.

My reasoning is that there are enough points in the episode that differentiate it from an actual real-world abortion debate so as to make the metaphor null, even more so because it's not about the traditional early-term abortion debate, but the late-term, risk-to-the-mother side of it.

But the point IMO, is that the uncertainty surrounding what would have happened if the creature was killed or not is what removes the abortion angle form the episode. It was an environmental issue, a genocide issue, but not an abortion issue. Clara didn't hesitate because it was a fetus, all-life-is-holy-and-all-abortions-are-wrong, but because *they just didn't know what they were dealing with*. That is the most important aspect of the dilemma.

The whole ""egg"" aspect could have been removed in favor of something else and none of the other themes would have suffered for it. Say, instead of being an egg, the Moon had actually been a perfectly round creature who was growing in mass because of an internal growth spurt, not due to reproduction. And in the end everything turns out fine because the creature leaves its shell behind, so we'd just have a hollow moon with a big hole in it, otherwise everything remained the exact same in the end. The whole debate surrounding the episode would have been absolutely identical, except for the abortion angle.",0,1412524139,null,0,false,0,cl11itf,t3_2iazo2,t1_cl11itf,t1_cl0trxq,null,1426673899,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

You must set him up with poachers who like to counter/quick build up starting from center field. He would fit perfect on Real, Chelsea, Bayern, and Dortmund type system because they all do this. 

Wenger needs to realize that his tactics sucks and have been countered for the longest time. He can't keep coming into games with the same mentality. People on Reddit are here predicting his line up and his approach to the game. Let alone Mourinho who is going to be able to predict and counter it with ease.

I didn't realise the 'saving' was so small - the threshold seemed like it'd have a bigger effect than that, but yeah I should have checked. Also there is the problem that higher tuition fees make it utterly impossible for older members of the workforce to retrain when they aren't eligible for student loans - I think damning someone just because they made a bad decision at 17/18 is the wrong thing for society to do (as it's just cruel) and the wrong thing for the economy (as we need an adaptive agile workforce in our rapidly changing world).

But as you say they still can't really be blamed as they weren't the majority party. I mean they even managed to get a vote on AV (okay, so they didn't manage PR) and that failed miserably thanks to an ignorant electorate.

**Price of product:** £22 for 125ml/3.8oz

**Where did you purchase:** Clinique counter at Boots, it's not always displayed so ask if you don't see it.

**Product claims:** ""Lightweight cleansing balm quickly dissolves stubborn eye and face makeups, including those with sunscreen. Transforms from a solid balm to a silky, fluid oil upon application. Cleans thoroughly, rinses off completely. Non-greasy. Non-drying. For all skin types.""

**About you:** Combo dehydrated break out prone skin, daily user of sunscreen and make up.

**Your opinion:** I love this stuff bar one thing, it is literally a short wide plastic jar of lard that you need to dig into. It's easy enough to just skim the top with your fingers initially, but eventually you'll have to brave getting the stuff up your fingernails. It melts into oil as you spread it around your face and gets most things off, it struggles with waterproof mascara and you'll need another remover for that (tested with the notorious Heroine Make Super Waterproof). Apart from that it leaves my clean without the stripped feeling, though if the water isn't warm/hot enough you can get leftover oil residue.

The best change so far is that the new Doctor is *intense* - he takes himself seriously and I take him seriously as a viewer. It's not all down to his character either, it seems the series got darker around him - I mean we have characters (minor ones, mind you) *die* every episode (the astronauts, the policeman, etc.) and so far their deaths seem pretty permanent (not sure about the Heaven plot though). It's interesting and refreshing, and I feel the new Doctor expands the boundaries of what a series like Doctor Who (the modern iteration anyway) can be.

That said, I do miss Smith - because the *character* he seemed to portray is kind of gone. I didn't feel that way when Tennant left - quite simply the 11th (and 10th albeit to a lesser degree) often made me feel better about life and humanity and basic things like love and happiness. Capaldi's doctor seems too dark to be able to make me feel better about anything. He's more *interesting*, simply because of the way Smith's and Tennant's were different to 12th; but 11th connected with me on a very personal level. I do however want to see if we get a genuine tear-jerker episode (like Van Gogh one or the Girl Who Waited) with Capaldi.

That said, it's just too easy a plot-point to say ""It ends there"". I've got a feeling the figurine will crop back up and eventually be delivered to Rupert from the Doctor's own timeline, making it all occur in a closed loop. No, closed loop stories make no sense logically, but they're an awesome plot device, used in the right way.

I'll admit I was wrong, in terms of time-travel and the like, but in terms of it being a script-written fictional story on television, I think there's definitely more to come that'll tie Orson into the Doctor's own childhood. I don't think it was a one-shot attempt to give a bit of humanity to the Doctor - showing his childhood was a huge risk in having it all backfire in terms of the audience hating mystery being taken away, so they'd have to use that risk somewhere down the line to justify it happening in the first place.

Sure, the audience ultimately loved that moment, but the scripts (including what justified the flashback to the greater story) would have already been written by that point, so I reckon that's still yet to come. And thus the figurine is the main thing that will come back in future stories, since we know the young Doctor himself won't be seen again any time soon (since he was an adult when he finally started time-travelling himself).",0,1412526394,null,0,false,0,cl12gkz,t3_2ibywa,t1_cl12gkz,t1_cl1023b,null,1426673461,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

""It was never confirmed who Danny's wife would be, which was part of the point.""

I don't think that point was that obvious, though. As you said yourself and I said in the main thread-starter, it was definitely 100% trying to show that Clara is the grandparent. I think that red herring was so forced upon us, that most of us missed that 'point' completely, at least on first glance.

I think us internet generation are more savvy to these twists potentially coming up, because when  mentioned this theory to my mother, she acted like I'd just grown wings and started flying about the garden, by how mind-boggled she was. And even I took a few days to process the information we'd been given properly.

So if it does come to pass that Clara isn't related to Orson, I'll definitely give Moffat props for creating a twist that not a lot of people saw coming, even if I might've worked it out myself. ESPECIALLY if the moment we find out is her death, before she ever gives birth to a Pink offspring.

What are you basing that on? The south even during the crisis had was ranked higher than the UK in the [Human Development Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index), meaning it had a higher standard of living. It's Economy has [rebounded](http://tribune.com.pk/story/709754/faster-growth-moodys-upgrades-ireland-by-2-notches/). In fact they paid back loans [Early](http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/ireland-in-talks-to-repay-imf-portion-of-bailout-loans-early-1.1877465). 

Northern Ireland is the [Economic Basket Case](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/northern-ireland-is-the-lame-duck-of-the-uk-29669915.html) and has been for some time. Being Part of the UK has had a [deeply negative](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/over-a-quarter-of-northern-ireland-workers-paid-less-than-the-living-wage-29730081.html) impact on the economy on this part of the island. Borders in general have negative economic impacts, but it has been disastrous for this island.

&gt; A product of the balance of coercion between Britain and nationalist Ireland in 1920,
&gt; the partition of Ireland installed an erratic and meandering international boundary of
&gt; 450km, cross-cutting 1400 agricultural holdings and 180 roads, and bisecting villages and even some individual houses ...  (O’Dowd et al., 1995: 274). 
 
&gt; From a more economic perspective, the Irish border shares many of the characteristics which Mitko et al. (2003) suggests are typical of other border or frontier regions, and which may be contributing to their underdevelopment. For example,Mitko et al. (2003: 21) cite low population densities in border areas in Southeastern Europe which, it has been argued, may lead to a lack of agglomeration economies and a reduction in the scope for local cooperation
&gt;  and learning (Petrakos and Tsiapa, 2001). ^[Source](http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforInternationalBordersResearch/Publications/WorkingPapers/MappingFrontiersworkingpapers/Filetoupload,175403,en.pdf)

If you need a stark image to realise the negative impact on Infrastructure and it's subsequent effects on both sides of the border take a look at this [image](http://www.discoveringireland.com/images/stories/Ireland/train_routes.jpg) this covers the railway network, but could be taken as an indicator as to the serious underdevelopment of all areas of the economy, never mind the doubling up and replication of services due to having two separate states on this tiny Island. Partition quite simply is bad for the Economy.

The untold story of the peace process, is that cross border co-operation has been its greatest success story, every effort has been to minimise the effect of the border.

&gt; There is now general agreement that inter-firm cooperation through networks, partnerships and supply-chains can, by facilitating knowledge exchange and reducing
&gt; transaction costs, contribute both to innovation and company competitiveness (Oerlemans et al, 1998). Dense patterns of “association’, alongside links between firms and other support institutions, have also been linked to cluster and regional growth(Cooke and Morgan, 1998). Case-studies of areas with high levels of such inter-organisational cooperation have generally also been characterised by social and economic uniformity, geographical contiguity, high levels of social capital (including, in particular, trust), and stable and supportive governance and support institutions (Braczyk et al., 1998). **Border regions are often characterised by exactly the opposite conditions: economic discontinuity, low levels of social capital, and governance which is at best divided, and at worst, antagonistic (Mitko et al., 2003). The result can be both a lack of knowledge sharing, diffusion and organisational learning (Petrakos and Tsiapa, 2001), and disproportionately
&gt; low levels of trade. In this context, cross-border cooperation can play an important role, countering the structural discontinuity of border regions and generating a potentially positive growth dynamic**. ^[Source](http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforInternationalBordersResearch/Publications/WorkingPapers/MappingFrontiersworkingpapers/Filetoupload,175403,en.pdf)

There is a trend in this Sub to spout overly simplified economic arguments ""such as NI needs 11Bn to be supported, the South doesn't have it"" it is indicative of a complete lack understanding of economics. First of all,  no one asks what led to the situation where we have to be spoon fed, why are we so reliant on subsidies, why is the economy stagnant? It has little to do with the troubles because Northern Ireland has not been a Net Contributor to the UK since the 1930's.

&gt; The weakness of the Northern Ireland economy became apparent in the 1930s, with its reliance on traditional industries which went into decline during the decade. Economic decline, halted only by the Second World War, put strain on Northern Ireland's social structure. ^[Source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/sectarian/brewer.htm)
&gt; 

The reality is that Northern Ireland was only really Economically Viable for about 8 or 9 years of its existence with mild reprieve during WW2, Creating an artificial state on this island was a dreadful mistake economically. The only saving grace was the [Welfare State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c86Gwsb5LY). 
If you have not been paying attention it is under attack. At the moment a free trade Agreement is being Negotiated; EU/US Free Trade Agreement (or TTIP). It will have a devastating impact on public services. The minimal advantages of being Part of the UK, such as the NHS, [won't exist](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/privatisation-agenda-drives-tory-policy-on-nhs-says-andy-burnham-9052640.html) in the near future. 

&gt; The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership The European Commission (EC) is currently involved in negotiating an FTA of unprecedented scale between the US and European Union (EU). This is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (or TTIP). The initial aim was to conclude negotiations at great speed (or ‘on one tank of gas’) by November 2014. It now seems that towards the end of 2015 is more realistic.
&gt; 
&gt; In addition to reducing tariffs and increasing protection for transnational investors, TTIP also aims to remove (or ‘harmonise’) regulatory barriers that restrict profitable trade between the US and EU.  These ‘barriers’ are often our most prized and hard-won regulations and standards that protect, for example, our labour rights, environment, food safety, digital privacy, and banking standards.^[Source](http://www.patients4nhs.org.uk/eu-us-free-trade-agreement-or-ttip/)

The advantages of being in the UK are being swept away, the Economic arguments for the state of Northern Ireland are paper thin (and on the verge of being torn to shreds). There are real economic advantages to an All Ireland state that have yet to be tapped. The trend of business is already seeking greater co-operation north and south, it is time for the institutions to follow suit. 

In terms of a border poll real searching questions have to be asked, Has the Northern Ireland experiment worked? What would be good for the Economy? We can not perpetually hide behind myth or an Emotional attachment to Identity Politics

false,IanCal,null,null,"&gt; Or does the market largely determine the amount?

This is mostly the case, but we can pick some fairly reasonable figures to have a bit of a guess. There are a ton of simulators to see what you'd have gotten if you invested like this over different time periods which will be much more in depth than I can be.

So first of all, nothing is guaranteed, and nobody really know what'll happen. These numbers are a bit of a stab in the dark, but should give you something reasonable to go on.

Quick answer, if you get 6% after inflation (seems reasonable): £8190 in todays money.

Longer, rambly answer:

The S&amp;P500 has, on average, returned about 10.5% over the last 40 years (i.e, invested all at the beginning, the amount you'd have now would be about the same as getting a steady 10.5% return).

The 10 year returns vary between an average of -1.38% and +19.21% (per year). There are no negative 15 year returns. The -1.38 was one of only two negative returns, and was around the global financial crisis.

I used this calculator:

http://www.firecalc.com/

This will use a reasonably basic investment process but try it out over *all 10 year periods between 1871 and now*. That means the results here show the great depression, world wars, all major crashes.

Lets try a 10 year, $600 a year:

http://i.imgur.com/LFPysNR.png

So worst case 4500 (probably the great depression), best case about 17 grand (maybe withdrawing just before the global crisis or investing just after a massive crash).

A pretty large glut around 8-9k though, which would be roughly in line with the 6+% I put there earlier.

All these things tend to get smoother the longer you go for.

&gt; Also, what is your opinion on tracker funds?

I think this term is generally used to refer to what I think of as ""index funds"", or ""index tracker funds"". These are in contrast to *actively managed funds*. Actively managed funds have people deciding what to invest in and when, whereas index funds take some measure and aim to always replicate it (like the FTSE100, say, or the FTSE ALL SHARE).

There is a lot of debate on this, but a lot of people subscribe to the idea that actively managed funds are worse as they very rarely beat index funds (this is backed up by empirical evidence). Proponents of actively managed funds would probably counter that good funds outperform index trackers. However, the difficulty of finding one of these is somewhere between hard and impossible, certainly for the average investor. Actively managed funds also have higher charges which can have a huge effect.

I don't think that people in favour of actively managed funds think index funds are bad though, just that they can be beaten.

Personally, I prefer index/tracker funds like the one I linked to. Large, wide spread of investments and low fees.

They're riskier than savings, but then I've got an emergency fund so I don't need to withdraw it unless something massive happens and I'm expecting to leave most of my investments until closer to retirement (they're mostly within retirement accounts anyway) so I've got 30 year horizons on most of this.",0,1412527375,null,0,false,0,cl12waw,t3_2i83b6,t1_cl12waw,t1_cl11xtb,null,1426673257,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

Have you invested in individual companies? If so, that's probably the source of your problem. You should invest in funds instead of individual companies, unless you have a compelling reason to choose individual companies. There are funds available for every risk profile, from funds that provide very little risk to funds that provide *a lot* of risk (for potentially high returns!). If you can share more information about what exactly you have invested in more advice can be given. 

**That said** investments are something you should look at over the long term, an investment might lose 10% *this year* but if it makes 20% every following year it's a fantastic investment! Every investment goes down at some point, an investors goal is for the investment to go up more than it goes down over their period of investment, not to always make gains. If you're looking at the value of your investment account every week then you're leading yourself down a dangerous path. The way to lose a lot of money when investing is trying to time the market, pulling your money out when it's going down and putting it in when it's going up: that's bad bad bad bad.",0,1412527765,null,0,false,0,cl132r3,t3_2id7qd,t1_cl132r3,t3_2id7qd,null,1426673174,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

    In order for Dtella to communicate properly, it needs to receive UDP traffic from the Internet.  Dtella is currently listening on UDP port 59859, but the packets appear to be getting blocked, most likely by a firewall or a router.  If this is the case, then you will have to configure your firewall or router to allow UDP traffic through on this port.  You may tell Dtella to use a different port from now on by typing !UDP followed by a number.

After one interval in ""The Time of the Doctor"", he states he's been on Trenzalore for 300 years.

Then, in ""Deep Breath"", the Twelfth supports this by stating he's over 2,000 years old. 

Can you really blame him for not being 100% sure? Our concept of ""Years old"" would be totally unknown to any species not of Earth, since it's the period it takes this specific planet to orbit our specific star. It would be like us visiting a planet with three small moons and meeting a species who ask ""How many lunar equinoxes are you?"".
