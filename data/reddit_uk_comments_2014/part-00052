Well, there you have it. This is exactly what would happen if it was free again. You want it to be free? Go up the hill on a different quarter day with a bunch of friends and spin some fire yourselves, because that's what Beltane was back when it was free; a group of friends who all wanted to mark Beltane and so wandered up a hill. 

However, if you still want the fire spinners, and the giant puppets and the bonfire and drums, you can't have that without making it a public event, and so having insurance and ambulance and police presence.

true,Rynoh,null,null,"It also depends on partner.  Both Cahill and Luiz look better when paired with someone that is willing to be the more defensive partner and a strong leader.  When paired together they both look worse because there isn't a set role for each and they just fit together poorly.

Cahill hasn't ever looked as good as he does now because he has always backed off and been to passive.  Paired with Terry who can no longer be the aggressor he has learned to be more proactive as a defender.

Int he last game Luiz might of been one of the main people guilty of giving up a goal but his pace and reading of the game allowed him to cut out many problems our other CB's wouldn't have.  

Defending is more about the some of the parts and not individual pieces.  It is about how they work together, cover for each other and I'm not just talking about the back 4.  Luiz and Cahill should both be better defenders then Terry but they don't fit together that well in our current scheme.  

We also have to factor in that Luiz wasn't given the luxury of focusing on one position this season.  He was injured early and has spent a lot of time in midfield due to our lack of talented depth their.  

With all that said I am loyal to the crest and I will support any and all players on our squad until they no longer are part of the club.  Ramires is my favorite player and has been invaluable the last few seasons, at this point with Mou's system I think he should be more of a rotational player only playing against top sides in up and down games or a sub once we have a lead against teams that park the bus.  I'd be sad if he was sold but The goal is to build the best team possible.  If we can sell Luiz or Ramires and replace them with an asset that better fits this team then that is what should be done.

Of course there is time to cut that out, but it's been two years and I'm not personally convinced it'll ever change. His English is a lot better now but I wouldn't call him eloquent, not his fault as it's not his first language but I wouldn't feel particularly inspired if he were to give a team talk.

Carlo we were just looking to offload and LA needed a keeper badly so I would assume the past relationship with LA over Keano helped and off he went. 


Then with Simon Dawkins I think it gets a little bit more complicated. Clearly he was not going to become a tottenham player so the club were just looking for a place for him to go on loan to try to get some money out of him at some point. I think Yallop probably has a relationship with someone at Spurs as he played at Ipswich for over a decade and from there Dawkins was sent out to be under his guidance. 

From this the clubs decided to have a partnership as Levy must've seen something positive on the business side of things as we've continued to add partnerships from that point on to this day. I would look at these partnerships as business for the most part and not where we could expect to see kids on loan. Off the top of my head our other partnerships are Madrid and the not even football related, San Francisco 49ers, so I think our partnerships leave us with little to gain on the pitch.

I can safely say that all of these goals have been achieved.

I'd argue against that - lots of people (myself included - mid twenties) use the specialist nighttime shows on Radio 1 (and 6music) to get recommendations from very knowledgeable people.  They're of very high quality.

I'm not saying I *only* get my music recommendations from the radio, but it's a big part of it.

You're right in that people have become used to having things their own way, but that's quite limiting and quite dull - after a while you will get bored of listening to the same music.  Obviously you can get recommendations from the sidebar on YouTube and Last.fm, but that's just recommending similar things - the beauty of radio is the serendipity, hearing something that you'd never have thought to have sought out or been recommended - that's it's power and main advantage (along with the knowledgeable presenters curating things).",0,1393016054,null,0,false,0,cflakmr,t3_1yisp0,t1_cflakmr,t1_cfl7zgu,null,1432500634,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2

The partnership with Real has been discussed to death. The partnership with the 49ers is probably fueled by Levy/Lewis's interest in being in the forefront of acquiring the potential NFL London expansion club, so effectively a networking move. The Quakes/Toronto partnerships appear to be marketing related.  

I was just curious if the ""partnership"" with the Quakes (which continually gets brought up anytime a player moves from Spurs to the MLS) was not meeting the expectations of the Quakes fans because of Spurs or because the Quakes ownership aren't pressing the partnership to try for a chance at one of these moves.  Seems (as a complete outsider) like the Quakes aren't jumping up and trying to land themselves in the middle of one of these deals.

Closer to home, was stuck with my 11 month old daughter at Gatwick for about 8 hours after our Monarch A320 dumped all its hydraulic fluid on the runway. Would they let us off the plane? They didn't want the delays caused by rounding up the passengers so no they would not.

If you just want a basic AMA on treatment for these sorts of injuries, good places to ask would be the Steadman Clinic in Vail or someone from James Andrews' practice in Alabama. When I lived in Vail I met Craig Bellamy and Jimmy Bullard when they were in town for knee stuff, so I know English clubs send guys there...along with loads of American athletes. Then Andrews is probably the most recognizable name in knee ligament work in the US, it seems like he's done repairs for 90% of the top American athletes who have been injured over the last few years. 

I'd say there's a very substantial possibility that Enrique was referred to one of these two practices.

For most people, your career is going to suck until you're 30 and peak before you are 40.

The property market is all wooden dollars. If you sell a 400k house you need to replace it with another 400k house.

My view is: if you're concerned about the long term future, invest in yourself. Get a vocational education. Move to a major city, get a higher wage, make lots of contacts to sustain you in your later career, get good at what you do.

true,markd123,null,null,"I'm in a very similar situation to you, I dropped out of school when I was 13 and started looking for work at 16 due to my Â£0 per week income. I'm currently 20 and the past 4 years I've applied for more jobs than I would like to admit. 

My work experience consists of 2 internships, the first was an unpaid internship with a local electronics repair company that did NOT require any qualifications. The second was a reasonably well paid Software Development role after I gained some useful qualifications.

Personally I think your problem is a self-defeating attitude. First of your claim that it cost Â£1000 to get 5 GCSEs is completely untrue, most colleges offer Essential Skills classes in Literacy, Numeracy and ICT for free, level 2 Essential Skills qualifications are Equivalent to 1 GCSE each. I can assure you these courses are insultingly simply and can be completed successfully without very much effort.

Level 2 BTEC courses are equivalent to 4 GCSEs each, I have 3 of them and all of them FULLY funded, these courses are also very simple, if you can find intensive versions of the courses they can easily be completed in few weeks. I also have 2 Level 3 qualifications one of which was fully funded the other was partially funded resulting in me spending Â£60 of my own money.

I would suggest that you look into local college courses starting in September, in your situation the courses will most likely be completely free and you may also be able to apply for a maintenance grant that you will not have to repay (That should be more Â£30 per week).

I also agree with other commenters that suggested you look for voluntary opportunities, the fact that you can't afford bus fare really isn't an obstacle as a lot of organisations are prepared to pay travel expenses and in some cases they will offer you the opportunity to take courses that result in accredited qualifications.  

I wish you all best in the future but nothing is going to chance unless you do something about.

Looking at the article it says:

So it took 50 minutes for an ambulance to get there, and only 17 minutes of that was a delay? So it sounds like their attendance target for your emergency is 33 minutes. Christ.

If it was me and my accountant said ""I think I have found a scheme that means you don't have to pay as much tax"", that would immediately make me suspicious because it's not been presented as an actual business investment. I mean, it was a fucking used car business which the very notion of hardly inspires immediate confidence.

Even if he believed it was legal it still implies an intent not to pay tax on money you have earned by other means. Personally I wouldn't accept that as an idea and would certainly get a second opinion about investing such a large sum of money in something that wasn't effectively going to earn me any money back. The fact he didn't seek out more information about it leads me to presume he either didn't care or was worried about how many other people knew what kind of ""investments"" he was considering.

There's a difference between being critical and being a cunt. I'm not saying you're a cunt, I'm just mapping out two points. There are plenty of people on here who are critical of the players and are able to get a good dialogue going about it. There are also plenty of people on here who are critical of players in a way that does nothing to encourage dialogue. Here are a few identifiers:

* Immediately assuming a contrarian stance (""I don't know why everyone on here thinks *x*, it's obviously *y*"")
 
* Insulting people 

* Interpreting support or patience as blind loyalty
 
* Interpreting an opinion different from your own as being an attack on your right to have an opinion. 

* Interpreting commonly held opinions as being part of a ""hivemind""

* Stating that there is such a thing as a true supporter or a ""right side"" 

* Blanket statements

I did make additional contributions for a year but the sums on that aren't great so when I'm able to afford to put more aside on a longer term basis I'll start a private pension.

We talk funny and chase cheese,"Look out for [Micro Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Men), a excellent BBC comedy drama from a couple of years ago that covered the development of the [BBC Micro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bbc_micro) project in the 1980s.

Essentially, the BBC decided to create its own branded 8-bit microcomputer to form the basis of a series of computer programmes (hosted by McNaught-Davis) covering the new phenomenon of [microcomputing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcomputer).

A tender was put out and [Acorn Computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Computers) won the rights to produce the BBC Micro, narrowly beating out [Sinclair Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Research) (lead by [Sir Clive Sinclair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Sinclair)).

Sinclair went on to own the UK games market with its low-cost [Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_ZX_Spectrum) computers, but Acorn's BBC Micro was hugely successful in the education market. Pretty much every secondary school in the UK had at least one BBC Micro - my school had a BBC model B in nearly every classroom.

Ultimately, the 8-bit micros of Acorn and Sinclair gave way to the 16-bit machines of Commodore and Atari, and then later to the IBM PCs that we all use today, but the Acorn staff went on to design the [ARM architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture) microchip, which is now found in nearly every single mobile computing device on the planet - you almost certainly have one in your house. So the [BBC's Computer Literacy Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Computer_Literacy_Project) of the 1980s has been enormously successful - it's not much of an exaggeration to suggest that those BBC computing programmes of the 1980s have touched far more people around the globe than almost any other BBC programme.

I did my own self-assessments for 5 years when I was self-employed and it really isn't that difficult when you know what business costs you can claim back on.  It's essentially almost anything that you spend money on that is a requirement to perform your job or run your business.

 So, 

&gt;There were things that I would never have thought of to declare (like how my working from home one day a week costs me extra money in heating).

That's a false equivalence. If I claim on a hammer drill, that's because it necessary to complete my work. If I have to pay for fuel to get to a job it means without that cost I couldn't actually get to the job I was intending to do. If I spend money on food because I'm working on site, I can claim that back up to a certain limit. There might be things that you don't even think of most of the time but so long as it is relevant to the business you conduct then it still seems reasonable when someone suggests you claim on it.

However if someone suggests I invest in a business for no other reason than to reduce the money I am required to pay tax on, only an idiot would think ""oh, ok, that sounds fine"".

I'm going to bet on Adrian and our defenders making the real difference here.  Tomkins and Collins are goddamned maniacs when they need to be, and the boys are likely to be charged up after three wins and some warm weather training.

Southampton isn't a pushover team though, and they play better football than the last three guys we've played.  I expect that if we can get shots on goal, we'll walk away with another three points -- it just comes down to how well our front line is able to make and take chances.

I do sometimes wonder, when I here how disillusioned people are with the main parties and claiming we need a shake up in politics - where were these people in the AV referendum? If the answer is that AV is not a real solution and only proportional representation is an answer (which is probably accurate) then why do more people not speak out in favour of it?

We were stuck on-board for a similar length of time, albeit without the delay before boarding that these guys had, so I can give you a step-by-step guide to how United handled things.

Here's what happened:

 - The plane had some instrument problem, and after 30 mins they moved the plane (full of passengers) to a maintenance bay.
 - We remained there for a further ~3 hours, during this time they served us drinks every so often.
 - Due to pilot duty time regulations, they then had to cancel the flight, so they arranged a bus to take us back to the terminal, and explained that we'd have to go back through immigration and collect our baggage.
 - In the baggage waiting area, they handed out leaflets explaining our rights to compensation under EU law, and how to claim some extra non-cash (vouchers/air-miles) compensation on top of that.
 - They directed us to buses that would take us all to a local hotel where we each got a room, plus dinner &amp; breakfast vouchers, pre-paid by them.
 - The flight was re-scheduled for 9:00 Monday, they arranged buses to get us to the airport
 - My connecting flight from SFO was re-booked automatically, a new boarding pass for that was delivered to my phone.
 - We took off shortly after 9am Monday, and they repeatedly apologised for the delay.

There were a few things they could've done better, but I think it's safe to say that they did a lot better than Ryanair.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;on facts alone the case is pretty weak

I really don't think this is true. In July 2013 and again in February 2014 the government published it's reports on the EU's competencies and how it effects the UK. Both reports came out positive and in favour of the EU suggesting it had economically benefited the UK. This was a non-partisan report based on evidence provided by individuals and business owners across the country not pro-EU propaganda and in fact it's been a little bit embarrassing for the government after their scaremongering about immigration, economics and the need for reform for an impartial report to turn around and basically contradict them. The CBI has said the exact same thing in the past - it represents a majority of the FTSE 100 companies and it is strongly in favour of remaining in the EU. 

In terms of immigration, I think Farage does not have much of a leg to stand on. In the last 2 months all the scaremongering about Romanians and Bulgarians has, as expected, been proven wrong. The EU have requested multiple time for the UK to provide evidence of benefit scrounging by immigrants saying that if there really is a problem they will do something but the UK has never provided a scrap of evidence. If you want no immigration at all you won't be persuaded by the UCL study that showed immigration is economically good for the country but you must accept your opposition is because you don't want immigrants in your back yard not because it has a negative effect on the country - that's a very weak position not based on facts at all. If Farage want's to go all the way back to 2004 and Polish immigration he will have a hard time arguing there has been a negative effect on the economy. 2004-2006 were boom years in the UK economy before the crash which was unrelated to immigration - the incompetence of the Labour government in not being ready for the numbers that arrived cannot be blamed on Clegg or the EU. Again there is no factual argument other than disliking immigrant on which to rely. 

Clegg is backed up by business and by the government's own impartial studies. That may be why he made the challenge now, a week or after that study came out, because he has so much factual ammunition in that report. Most of the 'facts' UKIP supporters normally throw around are inflated and inaccurate - for example UKIP claims the EU costs the UK ~Â£80 billion a year because they 'estimate' that over-regulation has cost the UK huge sums of money. In reality of course the UK's actual net contribution is currently ~10 billion and will fall below 9 billion next year. If Nick Clegg can undermine the silly sensationalist fantasy that Farage has created then Farage has to argue on the actual numbers and the actual opinions of influential people and at that point presumably many in his following will realise the exaggerated horse shit they've been spoon-fed and they'll start to doubt him. I hope Clegg quotes the many business people who completely disagree with Farage - he and his supporters seems to have a narrative that the EU is bad for business which is denied by the majority of businesses big and small across all sectors. Once that narrative falls he's fighting a losing battle.  ",0,1393028691,null,0,false,0,cflg775,t3_1yizi5,t1_cflg775,t1_cfkzsmw,null,1432503293,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

The Anfield wrap you've mentioned =Amazing discussion, two casts a week normally (rider is just music....good music but needs more talk about Liverpool in the lyrics and maybe Ill tune in.) Chat about the club and the football and The best podcast by far, bonus scouse accent.

Anfield index = Great stats involved and very good discussion

Day trippers = Hilarious Irish lads with a schedule of talking about recent and future matches but mostly having the craic.

TBT = Like an Anfield Wrap light in terms of content and quality (can't stand Harry Hugo the host though)

5times = The legends (and they have some proper legends on) chat about lots of things, mostly the club. No offense to the legends but they can be a bit disjointed and sometimes their views aren't as on the ball or as cutting edge as others but it's mostly good stuff.

Special mention; really miss pass and move, second best behind TAW, hope it comes back soon.

&gt;When I joined QPR in March 2010 we were rock bottom and heading for League One. We conceded too many and didnât score enough, which was a recipe for relegation. Within 24 hours of watching them I decided to build my team around Adel Taarabt and Ale Faurlin, an Argentine lad who is the best midfield player I have ever had. 

&gt;Taarabt has tremendous ability, as he showed for Milan the other night. Everybody warned me he would get me the sack, but I could see goals in him and that is what we needed. I told him that no matter how badly he played he would be in the team until the end of the season. He was fabulous for me.

true,thenumpty,null,null,"I think your view of the pension you are accruing is very negative for what it is. I would much rather be in a defined benefit scheme than be in a defined contribution scheme with the same contribution rates.

The main thing you should understand is that in a defined benefit scheme the sponsor, in your case the government, takes the majority of the risk. That is, if the investments do poorly they have to pay more. If people live longer they have to pay more. If inflation is higher than expected they have to pay more. Also, there are savings due to economies of scale.

In a defined contribution scheme, which is what the majority of private sector employees get these days, the employee takes all the risks. If investment returns are poor then they would get a smaller pension. If inflation is high then their pension would be worth less. If people start living longer they would get a smaller pension.

&gt; That sounds very nice, but it only compounds with CPI, which over 30 years or so will put it a long way behind the equivalent amount invested into the stock market.

This does not work as a direct comparison. You are comparing an annual pension figure at retirement with an accumulated pension pot. The pension fund you are in will be taking into account future investment return when setting the contribution and accrual rates. If they thought that contributions would only increase at CPI then either the contributions required would be MUCH higher or the pension you receive would be MUCH lower.

I'm not sure of an easy way to explain this but I suggest you research the differences between defined benefit and defined contribution pensions if you really don't value the pension you are accruing. I've heard people in the NHS complain about the recent changes to their pensions and at the end of the day what they receive is still very good.

I get that some of this may be hard to understand but I work in defined benefit pensions and receive a defined contribution pension and I know without a doubt which I would rather have.

true,Aygers,lfc99,,"I've also spent some time considering this, before deciding it's a bit premature, as we haven't finished in top4 yet. However imho, when we do finish in the top4 this season, that's when the hard work really begins. Right now we have one objective: get into CL. You know what they say right? It's easier to become the best than stay the best (or something along those lines). I feel staying in the top4 in future seasons will likely be even tougher than getting into top4 this season.

Reasons are simple, other clubs will prepare next season to attack our spot. Just look at what Spurs did during the summer, they've spent loads of money (granted it didn't work so far, but who knows what will happen if van Gaal does become their manager next summer), City and Chelsea will surely strengthen again and we're not even close to playing catch-up in terms of matching squad depth with those clubs. Arsenal are always strong and will surely spend more money next summer. Then you got ManU ... they are in such disarray it's impossible to tell what they'll be up to. Surely they'll be planning for some sort of a challenge though.

Together with Liverpool that's at least six teams who will, surely, at least have the resources to mount a challenge for top4, some of them for the league trophy itself. Add a surprise package that might sustain a long-term challenge over the season ... Other teams, the ones ranked lower, will prepare better for us. This season, especially in the first third of the season, I felt as though not too many teams were giving our team the credit we deserved (and shortly thereafter picked some balls out of their nets). No discounts next season, every game will likely be even tougher. Then add the Champions League and the cups. Nobody will be content going out of either domestic cup before, at least, quarter finals. Given our European rankings (which decides which teams are seeded for the group draws) we're likely to end up in a tough group. It's entirely possible our season starts a lot earlier (if we finish fourth we'll have qualification games to enter the group stages of CL) and all of a sudden you have a whole load of extra games that will be taking their toll on the squad, specially toward the end of the season.

With all that in mind one thing is clear. We'll need more players, quality players at that. Tough to say how many, but even if the guys who are currently on loan return to the club and get another chance, I think we'll still need a few players to add to the roster, even before we entertain potential departures. Then there's the fact Rodgers never managed a campaign that contains that many matches on such a high level. Hopefully things will move forward without a hitch but it's a learning process all the same. Add a few injuries, players losing form or potentially not reaching this seasons standards .... a whole different world of hurt for us as fans and the club as a whole.

As much as this season is important and the opportunity presenting itself for Liverpool being massive, I tend to think next season will be even more important. When we meet our goals, we'll have to consolidate our position, make sure we continue putting in top performances week in week out, for months on end, season after season. That will be a whole different type of challenge to be met and it is very tough to predict if this team and the people who are managing/directing them, are up to that task. Only time will tell and that's if we take our opportunity this season.

To conclude this wall of text, enjoy the ride, enjoy the success, look forward to a few more matches, hopefully among the European elite. But also beware, success this season will bring a whole different type of responsibilities, burdens and challenges for the next. It is truly next to impossible to tell what will happen and how Liverpool might cope with it.

 Seeing as there doesn't seem to be a very effective procedure for this kind of situation, surely they should implement some kind of time limit as to how long a plane full of passengers can sit idle, though this may increase delays. There must be some kind of solution for when this situation does arise, I suppose it could even be a simple as employing a few people to work in the terminal on nightshift and appointing one of the on board staff the power to let everyone back off the plane under extreme circumstances.

BA charge you for food, drink, bags and legroom whether you want them or not. Ryanair give you the option to NOT pay for those extras and for that reason they are good value for money!

Too many players who were great here in Belgium thought they'd be stars at some of the bigger clubs in the world, only to be severely disappointed.

Like I said, the CL thing was unfortunate, but honestly they shouldn't have let it get to that, having been well clear of Arsenal this time that season.

And the rest of your reasons would happen to us - other EPL teams have been, and will continue to, get better. United will improve next season, Everton might continue to build upon Martinez's impressive first season (though much depends on their ability to replace Lukaku), and if Spurs appoint the right manager they'll be much better as well.

Decent. Pay scales are all public information. They recently changed so new starters are on less money than a Barista at the cafe in Parliament.

Get into work early, eat something, check emails, have kit on before start of duty, briefing at start of duty, paperwork or patrol (mobile or foot) depending on workload, respond to incidents, rinse and repeat!

Easiest part is probably giving verbal warnings to people. Funnest part of the job is definitely my colleagues. I've worked a lot of jobs and I've never had such a laugh with work friends before I joined the job.

Hardest part by far is dealing with families who have just lost somebody. I.E Giving death messages, Coroner's Court, etc.

One of the principles for tax law is whether what you did was reasonable for a reasonable man.  This means it doesn't have to be right, but it does have to be reasonable.  

You inherit from this a variety of responsibilities.  On the simple end you're expected to ensure that your agent, if you use one, is provided with all your relevant records.  And that you make him aware of anything he needs to know.  

It's partly circumstantial, so if you run a small business and sell a second-hand sewing machine you used in the business for Â£50 you won't be expected to take specialist advice.  If on the other hand you sell a factory for Â£50million, it *is* expected that a reasonable man would seek advice to ensure he gets the transactional consequences right.

In all absolute seriousness do you think that he behaved reasonably when he claimed to have been trading in used cars, despite having trading income of just Â£3,827 **and** that after a bit of jiggery pokery with loan contracts he made a loss of Â£1,000,159?

On top of this, you should consider this:  When the case was to be taken to the Tax Tribunal he made an **[application to have the hearing in secret](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/money/tax/article3605510.ece)**.  He did so on the grounds that it would infringe his HRA rights and harm his earning potential.

So you have a man who entered into a scheme whose reality was beyond flimsy and who knew full well that being seen to have used the scheme would have a dramatically negative effect on his public image.

When you think about the things your accountant pointed out you were entitled to claim, can you think of a single one that you'd be afraid to admit to because people would be sufficiently appalled so as to not employ or buy from you?

These people know full well what they're doing when they use these schemes.  ",0,1393041911,null,0,false,0,cfll42h,t3_1yjxy3,t1_cfll42h,t1_cfle46g,null,1432505678,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

You see it's exactly this ""I'm going to say the first thing that comes into my head"" argument that makes you just as much part of the problem as the people you try to criticize.  

On what grounds do you say this?  Give me one, clear, unequivocal piece of evidence that there are no potential benefits whatsoever.  You can't.  Because your entire opinion is based on ideology.  The OP's linked article provides well reasoned, clear, understandable benefits.  You haven't attempted to deny a single one and you don't intend to; instead going for the kneejerk DailyMailesque view of the world that something is bad because you say it is.

Big Data offers us both threats and opportunities.  Of course there are serious privacy issues, dangers of data being misused or for nefarious purposes.  And then there are also chances, given advances in technology, to gather massive amounts of data in ways which were previously impossible, and put that data to work for us to identify things that we couldn't do before the advent of powerful computers and the internet.

Halifax reward account. Â£5 each month for paying in salary and paying out two direct debits. Debit card is basically never used. Only keep enough in there for emergencies the rest goes into savings so never considered the Santander 123 account. 

Inactive HSBC account since I swapped primary accounts. 

Credit cards. 

1 Barclaycard VISA. First credit card, nothing special about it. Recently had credit limit doubled and given 0% balance transfer for a year. Barely use this card. 

1 Capital One Mastercard. Cashback of 0.5% on all purchases plus Â£10 cashback once a year. All spending is done on it to maximise cashback. 

Both cards have shocking interest but as I'm on a direct debit for the full amount I've always paid in full each and every month so no interest ever been charged. 

Savings 

Premium bonds. Bulk of my savings in there due to being fed up with cash ISA and wanting a safe saving option. 

S&amp;S ISA. Vanguard lifestrategy. Only opened a few months ago. Potentially to be treated as a pension alternative, or at least aiming to not need to withdraw for as long as I can. Â£1000 in atm. Drip feed at least Â£130 a month in there. 

No pension through work yet but automatic enrolment starts in a couple of months. Not sure if it'll be a decent offering.

I'm 26.
I have a feeling I could be doing much more but I'm trying to put away 60% of my salary into retirement investments.

I have no faith in a state pension scheme, and to be fair I am working overseas and not making any contributions.

Luckily I avoided university and avoided a mountain of student debt.

If all goes well, I should be in a position to retire in about 10 years. Ideally by 35.

This is based upon maintaining a ~60% savings rate and averaging a growth of 5% P.A on the retirement funds, and then withdrawing 4% a year.

But life is what happens when you are making other plans, so this probably won't go to plan :(

I strongly recommend /r/financialindependence for advice on an aggressive retirement plan.

I'm british and up until two years ago i've luved in the uk, i'm quite entitle to post on a UK subreddit. 

As for my experience, without wanting to reveal information that would give away who i am, i worked within a charity in the UK that ran outsourced council services such as home care for blind people. 

As linked in the previous post, some social services depts within council did have their budgets cut. Whether that was necessary and whether they could have used their reserves etc is something I don't know enough about. I dare say many could whereas others have less means. 

Our charity was part of a formal network of disabled charities so in 2010/11 I was involved in discussions with people around the country about it. Many organisations who were previously contracted to deliver services did not have them renewed and the services itself stopped. 

There is evidence of this in my previous post and everywhere else if you care to look. I'm not disputing that there are financial reserves. My point was that budgets had been cut and that adversely affected disabled people. That is all.

true,maybelying,null,null,"&gt;I almost feel as if when I watch any of the episodes featuring him that the whole episode is about how awesome he is and how much better of a Doctor he is than the others.

Moffat was a long time fanboy that used to trade theories over the internet long before he was writing for the show, let alone running it.  His style of storytelling is somewhat fan-fictionish in that it tends to exaggerate key aspects of his characterization of what the Doctor should be, without balancing it out in other aspects.  It winds up being too over-the-top.

He tells enemies to run.  He stomps his foot and raises an army.  Daleks fear him more than anything else.  People that know him adore him and are blindly loyal to him.  He always wins, even when he loses, and never suffers consequences.  The history of the universe carries his thumbprints.  Humanity takes the word ""Doctor"" from his name.  Yada yada yada.

It's surprising that he's even bringing Gallifrey back because there doesn't really appear to be a need for any other Time Lords in the universe, the Doctor can do it all.

Sigh.  I like Smith's portrayal of the Doctor, I just don't like the way the character is presented.  The Doctor has historically been portrayed as the quiet hero.  Brash and arrogant certainly, but never really been placed on a pedestal the way Eleven has.  Even RTD touched upon the consequences of the Doctor's arrogance getting the best of him as some sort of counter balance to his power. I just always found it difficult to ""connect"" with Eleven.

It's personal preference, though.  I've said before in past posts that if I had to choose, I would much prefer strong character stories and development over epic and complex story lines and effects.  Others prefer the approach that Moffat takes.  Different strokes.

As a writer, Moffat knocked it out of the park with the stories he did under RTD.  I'm just disappointed that I haven't really seen that type of storywriting from him now that he's running the show.  He just seems more intent on rewriting the Whoniverse in his image, at least that's the way it feels to me.

Margaret Thatcher won three elections in a row yet they still decided she had to go. The footage of her leaving Downing Street for the last time, making a brief statement where if you read between the lines she says ""the bastards stabbed me in the back"", is legendary.

The party rules state that only 45 Tory MPs need to sign a letter of discontentment to trigger a leadership challenge. 45 is a tiny number, even when things are going swimmingly you could probably find 45 who'd complain, at least in private, about the leadership. And Tory backbenchers are very vocal and unspoken, so when things are going less well they're not afraid to come out and say so.

Most Conservative Prime Ministers are engaged in just as much a battle to keep the support of their own MPs as they are to keep the support of the country.",0,1393055931,null,0,false,0,cflp53s,t3_1yjn4z,t1_cflp53s,t1_cflebi3,null,1432507577,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

The major divide in the Lowlands is West (Glasgow, Ayrshire, Lanarkshire etc.) and East (Edinburgh, Fife, Tayside &amp; Aberdeen). The division usually consists of mild ribbing about dialect and accent, although everyone makes fun of Edinburgh, because Edimbuggers are tight.

Another division is between the Highlands and Lowlands. As a Lowlander who lived/worked in the Highlands for a while, I notice a tendency for Highlanders to think they were ignored/forgotten by the rest of the country because of the rural nature of the area (it's the size of Belgium with the population of Swansea). Lowlanders tend to think of Highlanders as backwards/overly Presbyterian.

There are other divisions which are not regional, e.g. sectarian divisions between traditionally protestant and Roman Catholic communities, which is particularly prevalent in the West of Scotland due to the intermixing of sectarianism with football rivalry. To be honest, there isn't much genuine religious bigotry left, because there are many genuinely religious people left: it's really just inherited tribalism.

Still very sparse compared to other networks but looks like it will be rapidly expanding throughout the rest of 2014. 

I would say though three's 3G is pretty damn quick. I got a 20Mb/s download speed on 3G with Three last night so don't be thinking you are loosing out without 4G with three. One consistent advantage of 4G over 3G with three right now is the upload speeds match the download speed whereas with 3G they are always much slower.

Or, they're doing it deliberately because the people in charge gain some personal benefit from the signing of terrible contracts in favour of the crap companies.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I've seen this idea  get wheeled out repeatedly in lots of discussions recently, from Tory politicians and generally on the right. You do realise it's a talking point don't you? 

Income tax is 26.2% of all taxation receipts. That means that the rest of taxation comes from VAT and other indirect taxation. Thus you're arguing the top rate brings in 30% (the IFS actually says 24% but let's run with this number) of 27%. However indirect taxation accounts for around 38% if you include Alcohol and Tobacco. 

Because the indirect taxes hit the general population more and they end up paying anything from 28% of their income to 31% in indirect taxation. 

So while the top rate may pay 30% of all Income tax revenue, it ends up being around 8% of total revenue. The rest comes from poorer brackets and it comes from indirect taxation such as VAT - which are hit the poor and middle class disproportionately ie - your gas bill isn't proportionate to income. 

I say all this because instead of regurgitating talking points - maybe a solid anaylisis of the figures would be better.

If you didn't log it with your insurers then that's who sold on your data, I absolutely guarantee it. 

I've worked in motor claims for the past 10 years, at insurers, brokers and claims management companies. The amount of places your data can be obtained from is frightening. 

These days it's very rare for a large insurer to pass on customer information, so that data has to come from elsewhere 

A claims management company I worked for would get their data for the sales team from a data company. They would have varying levels of data with varying costs:

The ""shitty"" data was the cheapest. This would be a database of names and telephone numbers of ""potential"" accidents. This often came from website forms that people had filled in and not clicked the ""I don't consent to my data being shared option"" - Often this is from price comparison websites so you know the person your sales guy is calling at least has a car - the sales guy then asks if they have been involved in an accident recently. It's completely cold and more often than not you don't get anywhere. 

The better end of the data comes from sources such as bodyshops, recovery yards, or accident claim websites - places where you know for sure that the person HAS had an accident, it's then just a case of getting them to come with you to make the claim.

what qualification should do is provide the funds to add the squad depth that we will need to play in PL and EU. we currently don't have that (or need it: the special needs one, had a valid point).

What is crucial is that we do get there this year because if we don't we will really struggle in future. This is the 'easiest' we are going to have it for a long time. 

- Man U are not taking up their 'automatic' spot. but joking aside, they will be back in the mix next year;

- Suarez will not be around if we don't get in. we are not a 1 man team but he does have a big impact;

- It is likely we'll be in UEFA if not in CL and that will require a larger squad than we can afford if we are to gain ground to make CL.

These are, of course, the same people (to take an overly optimistic view that many are businessowners, in contrast to just lazy jack-offs) for whom (to use a US example) Laureen Snider (1993) found to be committing corporate crime (such as fraud) to the cost of (conservatively) at least $325 billion, or at least around $3,250 per household. In reality, she placed the figure as probably more around $500 billion, or around $5000 per household,  and I'm pretty sure that people would have liked that extra $5000 in their back pocket instead of it going to an unscrupulous businessman. 

She also notes the legal punishments - only 4.9% of those caught received prison sentences, and 80% a fine of less than $5000.

Anyway I digress.  I had an apprenticeship in the Royal Signals when I left school but - luckily - I broke my wrist in basic training. I was offered a chance to go back in once my wrist had healed, but by that time I'd talked myself out of it after experiencing the few months I did. 

Probably one of the best decisions I've ever made to be honest, a lot of my Northern mates however came back from the first Gulf war absolute fucking nutters. I have no idea what they did to them out there, but it wasn't a good look. 


Personally though I think that the government should be supporting those that have fought for this country once they leave the forces, especially those with injuries or PTSD. Yet they don't. So it's left to charities. 

I agree though, it has changed in the last couple of decades with the succession of faux war after feux war. I think anyone who joins up nowadays to go and put themselves through that shit for nothing is mad.

Yes, I think I do.  To be perfectly honest, a paper from 1995 before the implementation of nationwide clinical databases is not the best way to counter this.  Have a read here of existing systems in place that generate randomised trial data on top of the ecological data to be generated by the care.data system.

&gt;There is no way, not the slimmest possible chance, not the most hairline nanometer long crack of a chance, that anything from care.data's medical records can come close to being relevant or accurate enough to be used for actual, real, medical research.

You're really that pessimistic?  I can see a thousand ways such data might be valuable.  Effectively the care.data dataset would be a huge, well documented, retrospective OR longitudinal resource.  Such data underpins a huge amount of science - you can't just set up a hugely expensive RCT with no evidence to support your foundations.

Charity Lotteries are exempt from many regulations that govern charities as far as spending/operations go. They don't fall within the realm of regular gifts, so certain liberties can be taken.

You are obliged by law to pay council tax. If you fail to pay the council tax they can make a filing with the courts. 

If they have to file with the courts to get the money back, that incurs costs, which they then charge you for.

If they had to make the filing, which cost money, but then you paid before going to court, they are essentially saying the court filing was necessary to get you to pay. 

If you've then ""refused"" to pay that and they have to file another court filing, then that again incurs cost.

If they were in the right to charge you the admin fee the first time around, then you should have paid it. If you didn't then by the same rights they can do the same this time around. I mean it works the other way around too, if they charged you admin fees they weren't entitled to charge, you could equally take them to a small claims court. 

I think that if you were required to pay the admin fees the first time around, then you *definitely* owe them the Â£68. If you can prove somehow that the Council has made no effort to get in contact with you to pay that off, and that they somehow gave you the impression you didn't need to pay it then at court you may be able to argue against the second admin fees.

From the sounds of it though you'd have to go through all that stress and hassle just to *maybe* save Â£50.

If I were you I'd contact the council and tell them you can't afford to pay back the Â£110 in one go so instead you'll offer to pay back in monthly installments, and basically negotiate like Â£10 a month for like a year. 

They only care about getting the money back, if you say you cannot afford to pay it all off faster than that tell them they risk not getting the money back at all due to your financial situation.

If they broadcast the specialist shows during the daytime, there'd be a massive drop in listenership, which would hugely reduce the exposure that this new music would receive.  They've actually done this as one offs before ('specialist takeovers'), and the complaints outweighed the praise.  If nobody listens to the new music being broadcast, what's the point in it being broadcast?  By programming 'popular' music during the day, they can retain their listeners and advertise the fact that these specialist music shows exist and are available to listen to at any time.  They also intersperse the popular stuff with new stuff, live stuff, introducing new sounds and bands to the mainstream, and things like that.

Daytime radio is designed for dipping in and out of - on any radio station, not just R1 - because most people are too busy doing other things to concentrate on the radio - that's why the playlist is repeated relatively heavily.

Assaidi played enough with us, then was shipped off. He's played a lot for stoke and still doesnt look like the quality of player we need, despite scoring a few goals. Borini is exactly the same. Scored goals, but generally his over all play is lacking. 

Alberto granted hasnt played much. But is it not a good enough sign of the confidence Rodgers places in him, when he cant get more than 10mins in a game we're cruising to a win in? Now Teixiera is getting the nod above him. Even when alberto comes on, he looks lethargic. For a guy whos not played much, hes not helping his chances by dawdling about for 10minutes. He's playing against tired players, and you'd think he'd have the sense to bust a gut and exploit that tiredness. Showing rodgers his willingness to compete for his place.

I think the days of the likes of John Peel introducing Krautrock and other experimental music on mainstream radio has died.

I hate to sound like a condescending nob (and I honestly don't mean to!), but maybe new music right now is just not your thing?  I say that because after listening to the specialist shows over the last few years you can tell it's been evolving and changing, and new stuff being introduced (trap, grime, dubstep, amongst others - all of which are or were experimental sounds).  Dubstep actually first gained mainstream traction because of John Peel, then Mary Ann Hobbs - specialist music shows on overnight R1.

I would highly recommend to you to give a show or two a listen - you might get some value out of it. Not sure what you're in to, but here are some:

I'm waiting for you to mention the USSR so I can remind you that they are the ""Union of Soviet **Socialist** Republics"", and that by definition there is no such thing as a ""Communist"" country.

By definition, stateless Communism comes at a time when Capitalism has been abolished, and the Socialist state has decided to step down. Prior to that, any state that describes itself as ""Communist"" or ""Socialist"" nowadays merely aims to survive a Capitalistic economy revolving around competition, waiting in the hope of its collapse. Thus, we see in China, where they act decidedly un-Communistically.

The USSR failed primarily because it felt it could force the economy to its will, in spite of itself being a contradiction of Orthodox Marxist views that only developed, industrial countries could be successfully Socialist. 

It alienated other countries to the point where they were the victim of trade embargos of vital goods, the centralised government became inefficient (a rarity for authoritarian regimes) etc.

They failed partially because they thought they could ignore the competitive aspects of the capitalist economy (wanting to abolish capitalism anyway) and forge their own path (leading to the stereotype that Communism is naturally associated with economic decline), and partially because their embargoes means they were forced to live in an unsustainable economic ""bubble"", which would collapse after a long enough period regardless of what ideology the government was.

The benefit? It dragged Russia from a  agriculturally-based economy into the industrial age, practically eliminated illiteracy and made it a modern nation rather than the rural backwater it was before. This came at the obvious price, however.

Another good example is Cuba - tiny country, embargoed by the US, but at the joint-top of the Education Index (the state pays for private tuition if you can't travel to the schools), and is frequently seen as having one of the best healthcare systems in the world, as well as low violent crime. Still not perfect, of course, but such is the constraints of the economic system.

With the team we have right now I'd easily expect us to make it through the group stage based on individual matches.

What I don't think we have right now is the squad to cope with the extra games. We have a strong first XI, and maybe we have a bit of redundancy in central midfield, but we lack quality in depth in defence, and we lack quality attacking players to bring off the bench or to start if we want to rest Suarez/Sturridge/Sterling. 

I think to be at a Champions League level looking at the season as a whole you need to be able to rest a few players against Premier League opposition before mid-week CL games, and you need to have players who can come in who can still get you a result.

true,leviticusreeves,scot-Aberdeen,Aberdeenshire,"I have a pretty good job, and earn enough to be comfortable and not worry about money too much. But I was brought up in council estates with both parents on the dole. In fact my whole family, my parents, their parents, my aunts and uncles, were (back then, in the late 80s through to the late 90s) the sort of career benefit claimants that are so vilified today. We lived in a small industrial town that was gutted of jobs in the mid 80s, and the patriarch of my family, my great-grandfather who died in 1999, always told his kids and grandkids that what him, his brothers and his friends did during the war meant that his family should never feel bad about taking from the state. This helped inculcate the attitude that it was better to have a relaxed life on the dole, where raising kids was everybody's focus, than it would be to work for less money and spend less time as a family.

But me, my sisters, and nearly all of my cousins are doing very well, with good jobs, university degrees, mortgages etc. And we all made it through in a time when this was possible, when rent was a lot cheaper, when anyone could go to university and not have to worry about fees, and when career opportunities where available to people pretty much just for turning up.

My family was wrong to think that it was OK not to work or provide for themselves, but what's important is that they weren't punished for doing so. Most importantly, our family lives were stable and happy, and the kids were never punished for having parents with silly hippy ideals. Because of this, we all made it out and turned out just fine.

I never see that now. Never. When I go back to my hometown, the families who are in the council estates are third or fourth generation benefit claimants. But all of them work - shitty, menial, low paid jobs, that they are forced to do to continue receiving benefits. They constantly struggle to find child support and spend much less time with their kids than when I was young. The kids in turn grow up to do the same menial, shitty jobs, and are totally sceptical that anything else is possible. I don't even know if they are right or not. But I do see the stress and anguish, the low self esteem and the anger, that just wasn't part of our lives on the dole 20-30 years ago.

When you give someone money to live rather than work, it may well discourage them from contributing meaningfully to society. But it means that they are able to raise kids with high ideals in comfort and peace. And these kids will have a chance in life, and they may go on to become valuable tax payers and valued members of society.

What's been going on lately is punishing children for the sins of their parents. It's building a whole generation of British workers whose expectations in life are not much beyond that of a third world factory worker. You don't need much of an education in economics to see that might just well be the point - decreasing the cost of labour in the west so that western countries can try to compete economically with the east. In my day it was near-consensus that such lives were lived beneath human dignity, that no-one should have to live like this, no-one deserved that sort of life, and we hoped for a future where no-one would. Since the 20 year propaganda campaign, since the Daily Mail became the most read paper in Britain, attitudes have changed and apparently we would rather have our fellow citizens doing the most degrading and soul consuming work than claiming our tax money.

I don't even blame Paul Dacre or Rupert Murdoch or Thatcher or Cameron - I blame the British people for becoming heartless, uncaring, I'm-alright-Jack wankers who were so easily won over by arguments in the popular press that any politics textbook would help you identify as fascist.

true,Etular,eng-cumberland,Cumbria,"&gt;The whole communism has never been implemented argument.  Let's face it, it doesn't incentivise the economy.

I would argue that's because, in a communist society, there is no ""economy"" in the traditional sense of the word, as there'll be no such thing as a monetary system. Theoretically, things will be produced as they're needed.

Communism hasn't been implemented in that, as a worldwide theory, it can't be implemented. The closest snapshot we have of it is in Revolutionary Catalonia, or the Ukrainian Makhnovist movement, before they were stomped out by military force (the latter by the USSR, themselves).

&gt;People are, generally speaking, completely selfish individuals so need motivation to work.  I'de rather it was the carrot than the stick.

Evidence? Psychology has a modern paradigm that altruism doesn't exist, but if you look into the philosophy of science, paradigms are shaky, and tend to come and go.

As noted by Roger Gomm, most beliefs on science are influenced by their social context, anyway - such as the ignorance of Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"", with the misconception that his view promotes competition as the cause of species survival. Of course, as reiterated in Kropotkin's unknown work on ""Mutual Aid"", both co-operation is the most important factor, and even Darwin himself acknowledged it as a factor in the sane book.

&gt;I know it's an unpopular opinion but I actually think capitalism is a good system.

There are many different definitions of capitalism - from laissez-faire, to social democracy, to even the type of so-called ""state capitalism"" we see in China. 

A state can be both Communist and Capitalist, insofar as the former can be an end and the latter a means. In theory, all Communism means is to want to abolish the class system, wealth and eventually the state, to live in a society that would be deemed akin to modern-day Anarchist thought.

&gt;Also, you can have welfare systems in a capitalist framework.

Indeed, Social Democracy - hated on the right for not being economically ""free"" enough (i.e. People not starving to death), and the Left for not going far enough. Ultimately, however, the most sustainable form of capitalism.

I'm not utopian (much) - I greatly admire countries like the Nordic countries who have been able to make the best use of a capitalist system.",0,1393074847,null,0,false,0,cflrzq1,t3_1ylz5e,t1_cflrzq1,t1_cflrsg5,null,1432508996,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I think our first XI is strong right now, but outside of Allen/Gerrard/Henderson/Lucas/Coutinho in central midfield, and perhaps Johnson/Flanagan at RB, I really don't feel like we've got solid cover. If we had a mid-week game against Bayern Munich next week I really don't think we'd be able to rest key players like Suarez and Sterling after 45-60 minutes and bring on attacking options who would still have a good chance of getting a result. 

The other big problem is that we've got pretty much nobody in the squad outside the first XI we can sell for a reasonable fee. We could possibly sell Agger, but then we have no CB cover.

true,Galerath,null,null,"&gt;If that's still not good enough then I'd look closer at the nature of the military itself and why we're intentionally mentally crippling those who join up. 

Because it's a requirement for a military to function properly that the foot soldiers obey orders. Part of that is the structure imposed on their days, etc. 

The problem is that you're requiring individualism of people leaving a job where they have been *purposefully taught not to be individuals*.

This isn't a 9 to 5 employment, this is a 24/7 employment. The military is all encompassing, as it has to be to mold people into effective soldiers. Leaving the military is not just like quitting a job at Primark, it's leaving an all encompassing existence.

I don't think you can even vaguely compare leaving the military to leaving any other profession, so I think it has special requirements on the part of the employer (the Government) to ensure the wellbeing of those people. 

&gt;But no, I don't care that they're leaving a profession. They enjoy the benefits of the freedom to join or not join as do the rest of us - and should understand the repercussions and responsibilities of the same. 

And this is an unfair requirement. Nobody knows how they're going to mentally react to being shot at before it happens.

I don't think its helpful to talk about what people ""deserve"" or don't ""deserve"", but when you earn minimum wage and see someone who is unemployed that has a better lifestyle than you, it's not hard to see why there is so much resentment of the benefits system.

&gt; Everybody laughed. It was so ridiculous. The idea of the likes of THEM wanting or having such things! Any doubts that any of them had entertained as to Owen's sanity disappeared. The man was as mad as a March hare.

&gt; 'If a man is only able to provide himself and his family with the bare necessaries of existence, that man's family is living in poverty. Since he cannot enjoy the advantages of civilization he might just as well be a savage: better, in fact, for a savage knows nothing of what he is deprived. What we call civilization --the accumulation of knowledge which has come down to us from our forefathers-- is the fruit of thousands of years of human thought and toil. It is not the result of the labour of the ancestors of any separate class of people who exist today, and therefore it is by right the common heritage of all. Every little child that is born into the world, no matter whether he is clever or full, whether he is physically perfect or lame, or blind; no matter how much he may excel or fall short of his fellows in other respects, in one thing at least he is their equal--he is one of the heirs of all the ages that have gone before.'

&gt; Some of them began to wonder whether Owen was not sane after all. He certainly must be a clever sort of chap to be able to talk like this. It sounded almost like something out of a book, and most of them could not understand one half of it.

&gt; 'Why is it,' continued Owen, 'that we are not only deprived of our inheritance--we are not only deprived of nearly all the benefits of civilization, but we and our children are also often unable to obtain even the bare necessaries of existence?

Just me being picky, but I think it's a shame that they *can't* argue back - there's never a platform, and even when there is, there's the common view that they aren't entitled to an opinion.

Particularly with immigrants, it's expected that they should uncritically worship this country and its values. If they have any complaints, regardless of how valid, they're met with ""You **chose** to live here, so if you don't like it, get out!"". The only people that can legitimately complain about Britain, apparently, are the British - even a second- or third-generation immigrant is likely to be unable to find a platform or be free from the ignorant dismissals.

As for the poor, in line with social factors, there's the norm of ""They don't work hard enough"". We have the false belief that our country is ideally meritocratic, with the best at the top and the worst at the bottom, with everyone having equal opportunities to achieve, even if not the case - so the poor get dismissed as the people who are lazy, or who we should care less about. At least it's an improvement from history, where we were literally seen as barbaric savages.

The rich have platforms and the education to hold a coherent argument, as well as the belief that their view somehow is worth more.

But they *do* know that being shot at - or indeed being shot - might be a part of what they're signing up for.

That's what doesn't make sense here. If I take an office job I *know* I'll be sitting down all day and if I don't want that - I should find another position. 

If I take a job in a surgery I should know I'll be around blood. If I take a job as a firefighter I should know I'll be around fire. If I'm not OK with that - I should look elsewhere. 

I certainly shouldn't expect anyone to give special dispensation as a result of that. The responsibility remains on the individual to realize the magnitude of what they're signing up for. Perhaps this should be tested on entry as a caveat to weed out those too stupid to realize what they're getting themselves in to? 

PTSD or injury isn't a certainty - therefore compensation should come on a case-by-case basis depending on how it has affected the individual.

true,syuk,ter-Sark,Sark,"Consider elements which aren't just trappings like consumer goods, but are 'extended' health services and staples like school meals and other discounts people cannot access just because they are in work.

saying someone has a 'better lifestyle' is not the way to look at it imho, the 'base' of their lifestyle is what infuriates people. Free glasses, dentist, childcare, pension being paid in are maybe things some people who are in work would greatly appreciate, and would actually help them do better in work and achieve more if they had them - everyone should 'get' these things.

What is alarming is the number of people who use children to access benefits, when hard working couples find it hard to support a child through their work. 

Compare the life chances of a child brought up on benefit street with a child brought up on the back of hard work, the cost of each and contribution to the state.

calling these things 'benefits' is also a joke, its just a system that ensures we will have a change of government every 10 years or so, one face of the state promises crackdowns on benefits, the other promises extensions to it - rinse and repeat.

The middle classes and those in lower wage jobs are struggling to make ends meet, and of course that resentment has to shift somewhere and benefit claimers are the easiest target. Everyone KNOWS someone who is on benefits, but how many people can say they know any bankers? It's easier to slag off Margie who lives down the road receiving 20k in benefits than a faceless banker. The system is broken and there does need to be changes to make sure the people that really need benefits are receiving them and that the ones who are taking advantage of the system are dealt with.

&gt; Not if you removed the subsidies, expropriated the companies unable to compete or offer realistic prices without handouts, and redirected profits and giant salaries into cheaper tickets.

If you removed the subsidies ticket prices would immediately go up and certain lines would see a huge reduction of service as unsustainable business folded, at least in the short term. In the long term train services would be expected to compete with other forms of transport (buses, cars, cycling, even planes on long distance journeys), and the quality of services and the prices charged for those services would be set in relation to that. 

I'm broadly supportive of this, but what I was disagreeing with is that privatising the rail service (more than it already is) will quickly translate to cheaper tickets. At the moment the price of every ticket is being paid for by the taxpayer in the form of subsidies. Take away those subsidies and it is the passenger that has to pay for the true cost of that ticket.

True, which is why you have to know what you're getting in to before signing up. It's a little late to disagree with the conflicts you're pointed at - once you're already under orders. 

&gt; you need to direct your indifference to the politicians I think.

Oh believe me I've no love for the politicians that have entered us in to the conflicts they have in recent years. Blair for instance should be had up on war crimes charges. However that's not what this topic is about. 

&gt; Doctors, police and firemen all get to go home to their families at night, soldiers spend long extended periods of time in dangerous situations - their situation is very much different.

Right. And if you don't realize that before you sign up - you clearly haven't thought the situation through carefully enough. 

Regardless: Joining the military remains a choice. There are other career routes and 'lack of jobs' is a very shallow look at the myriad of reasons that someone might sign up. However in doing so you ought to take on full responsibility for the vocation you choose and the life you decide to lead.

Nothing compares to quality of a good cask ale. You can't bottle a beer, or serve it on tap, and get close to the rich and delicate flavours of cask beer.

A [cask](http://inntrouble.innserveltd.co.uk/UserFiles/Images/Cask/CaskDiagram.png) is unpressurised and beer is delivered by gravity or a pump.

The beer is a living product, and is still (slowly) maturing in the cask while it's sealed. It's actually possible to serve it too soon, and the beer won't taste right. Darker ales in particular need time to mature. Really dark and strong ales can be aged for a year in the cask.

Sealed, most ales have a shelf life of a month or two, and that's in a cool cellar. Once opened they have three days to a week. Air gets into the cask, biological reactions start happening, and it will sour.

When we open a beer, we roll it around a bit first, stick it on a rack, stick in a spial (or peg), and let the yeast settle. The rolling stirs the yeast up a bit, and gets it active, helping to improve the flavour of the beer.

Once the yeast has settled, which can take a day, but often less, it can be tapped, checked (for clarity and taste: my favourite part), and then hooked up to a clean line to be pulled through to the pumps at the bar.

The limited shelf life means cask ale is a relatively local thing. We sometimes get casks in from 200 miles away, but it's usually under 100 and often under 50. Someone trying to import only a few cask ales a continent away would have to courier them, vastly inflating costs to the bar, which would then have to apply it's mark up, and you'll end up paying the price of fancy meal for a pint of beer.",0,1393079522,null,0,false,0,cflsxmk,t3_1ymckp,t1_cflsxmk,t3_1ymckp,null,1432509438,15,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,15

true,[deleted],null,null,"I do understand what you mean, when I revised my mocks I started 4 days before the mock revising everything cramming and I did get my AABB from that but right now I only remember like 70% of the stuff. That's why I think if I continually revise from now until the exams, I should be able to get higher.  Believe me if I wasn't revising right now (lol) I'd probably be wasting my time doing nothing/watching TV shows. So through that I think it's just more efficient time expenditure.

 A is the highest grade in AS and A* in A2s. My college is known for having tons of oxbridge students every year (I think last year it was 21 people) so I believe I am safe in that regard e.g help applying/interviews/personal statements. I'm also quite confident and social so I can manage to hold conversations easily. 

I think the last bit you said was very important though, to not skimp on revision. I believe I'll just need to make this a habit of revision. Previously I would watch shows/whatever and then try to make time for revision. If I can do the opposite of that I think I can still withhold my sanity and still get good grades.

No, that's incorrect. If you earn 40k and donate 10k, you pay the amount of income tax that somebody with an income of 30k would pay.

So theoretically, if you donate your entire income, you will pay no income tax, however you will still have to pay National Insurance on your income. On 40k, income tax is 6k and national insurance is 4k, just to give you an idea. You also still pay student loan repayments and any other taxes.

PSA: if you earn any income at the 40% rate (your income is above approximately 41k) and make any donations to charity using Gift Aid, [you can claim a tax credit by phoning HMRC *or* filling in a tax return or tax relief form](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/individuals/giving/gift-aid.htm#6).",0,1393080552,null,0,false,0,cflt6yg,t3_1yjxy3,t1_cflt6yg,t1_cflhx61,null,1432509561,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Whilst we have unemployed people here, thousands applying to jobs (such as is mentioned here often in these benefits debates), should we really be letting uneducated peoples whos first language is not English live here?

We're restricted from setting up our own trade deals, or immigration policies via the EU. The EU is getting closer to a federal state, to deny or ignore that is blatant ignorance. A federal state with equal states that are poorer than ours is going to hurt us, as our duty would be to spread the wealth, enriching these poorer nations.

We could use this as a bargaining chip for power. Moving the ECB to London would make sense as our financial centre processes 40% of international transactions, New York only 20%. We'd need to lead Europes financial centre, could lead a joint armed forces, whilst selling German cars, as we're native tongued English and thus the best salespeoples/diplomats for North America and Australia/New Zealand. Even greater integration for the commonwealth in the EU could be pushed by us. 

The government has a severe lack of foresight in regard to the EU. We either push it in a direction we want, accepting deceased qualities of life for our people due to the huge and obvious disparities in wealth, or we leave and look towards the commonwealth and much greater towards the international markets as a whole.

They should also have checked with 020 8750 3939 to see if there were any NOTAMS (flying restrictions) in the area on that day... I can't be bothered to search around to check if there were, but there are often restrictions on the Brighton seafront - for example recently there was a restriction within 3500m of the Conference Center due to the Labour party conference (which would have included this location by Lewes Crescent)... it is very possible there was a no fly restriction on that day specifically for the marathon!  

It's also about safety... if you fly something like this over a main road and its power cuts out or it suffers a mechanical failure and crashes into a car causing a fatal accident then you as the pilot have effectively murdered that person in the eyes of the law - as although you are unregistered, you are expected to be able to operate the aircraft safely within the boundaries of its likely performance and reliability.

true,Aygers,lfc99,,"&gt; Any spending in the summer is going to have to come almost entirely from FSG's pockets.

Another thing to consider is, when we make Champions League group stages there's about ten million euros in prize money. Also increased match day revenues and right for TV broadcasts will add a lot of funds to our coffers. If I'm not mistaken the club are likely looking at roughly another thirty million euros from those sources. Then there is also prize money for winning games, at (if I'm not mistaken) 1,5 million for each win and 300k for draws, both in euros.

Given we haven't spent that much during the previous summer (I think net was seven million pounds spent? If anyone can verify) and nothing during the winter (when we had a rumored war chest of 25 million pounds), add the prize money for finishing in the top4 and the increased TV revenue funds (do they kick in after this season or the next one?) and suddenly the club are sitting on a lot of funds. Then add the recent sponsorship deals and the potential US tour revenue ... starting to look like FSG will hardly have to kick anything toward transfer funds.

Of course I'm ignoring expenses all together and the real size of our transfer fund is unlikely to be the sum of everything I've listed above. If we pick up a quality free transfer (thinking of Matuidi and Menez here), add a 20+ million pound player and a couple reasonable purchases, we could almost do with about 40-50 million pounds transfer spend.

The real issue is not that benefits are so amazingly generous its that work wages are so poor. Benefits are part of the problem with that because they subsidise low wages, you probably work with people who are on benefits who use this to top up thier wages.
Why are we not saying to organisations that enough is enough, either they pay a living wage to thier workers and take a cut in profits? The benefits system is making quite a few people very rich, providing them and the organisatikns they run with labour (just like yourself) who would not be able to continue there if the state was not topping up thier wages. Thats the real scandal not someone picking up 20k a year on the rock and roll!

true,Etular,eng-cumberland,Cumbria,"&gt; Whilst we have unemployed people here, thousands applying to jobs (such as is mentioned here often in these benefits debates), should we really be letting uneducated peoples whos first language is not English live here?

My answer: Yes, because freedom of movement is a liberty everyone should be entitled to. If you can't get a job in your own country, you should have the freedom to move to another country to look for one - such is a commonality that liberals and libertarians on both left and right sides of the spectrum would agree with. There should be no ""I was lucky to be born here, so I get preference"".

I'm making such an argument, even in spite of the fact that I dispute your claim that most of them are ""uneducated"" - if they were ""uneducated"", they wouldn't have the opportunity to apply for said jobs. The belief that immigrants are coming to this country and are getting jobs in medicine etc. thrown at them is, quite frankly, garbage - they get the jobs because they are **better** than our own, which shows a fundamental failure in our education system (and, arguably, our national mindset towards education) to meet with the job market.

I oppose the idea that, when we lose the competition, we should rig it so we win anyway.

&gt; We're restricted from setting up our own trade deals, or immigration policies via the EU. The EU is getting closer to a federal state, to deny or ignore that is blatant ignorance. A federal state with equal states that are poorer than ours is going to hurt us, as our duty would be to spread the wealth, enriching these poorer nations.

Whilst you see something as being innately wrong with this, I openly support it - it's a sign of the inevitable globalisation, that we're going to have to *learn* to acknowledge the existence of other countries in worse states than ours, instead of maintaining a blissful ignorance and apathy. 

I promote the idea of increasing the opportunities for poorer countries, even at our expense, so they can be on the same level as us - after all, is such not the *primary reason* they want to move here anyway, as a so-called (to use a term commonly applied to the US) ""land of opportunity""?

&gt; We could use this as a bargaining chip for power. Moving the ECB to London would make sense as our financial centre processes 40% of international transactions, New York only 20%. We'd need to lead Europes financial centre, could lead a joint armed forces, whilst selling German cars, as we're native tongued English and thus the best salespeoples/diplomats for North America and Australia/New Zealand. Even greater integration for the commonwealth in the EU could be pushed by us.

The impression I got from this is that you're not exactly against EU membership, but merely want a British dominance within the EU, am I correct?

&gt; The government has a severe lack of foresight in regard to the EU. We either push it in a direction we want, accepting deceased qualities of life for our people due to the huge and obvious disparities in wealth, or we leave and look towards the commonwealth and much greater towards the international markets as a whole.

&gt; 'Toddling along' is not an option. UKip is decisive, which a lot of people like. Labour should say the opposite, as in greater EU integration and for the UK to join the Eurozone (Euro), and be decisive. This would at least give people a bit of clarification, rather than more toddling along, or leave the EU and thats that.

In which case we seem to be in agreeance, then, as far as I can tell - I've constantly been in support of the rise of an opposing left-wing populist movement or, as you term it, a left-wing movement that is very decisive on its aims, and acts as a counterpart.",0,1393082725,null,0,false,0,cfltsns,t3_1ylz5e,t1_cfltsns,t1_cfltfm1,null,1432509846,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;Is this relevant? All military personal receive comprehensive training. I don't think that's an issue here. 


Yes, because I'm drawing a parallel between duty of care before during and after employment.

&gt;&gt; 3: Due to the specific nature of military employment, there is a duty of care not just whilst on the job, but also to successfully reintegrate former employees with civilian life. 

&gt;Where does that begin and end, then?

It should begin when they leave active service and end when they're psychologically capable of reintegrating with society. 

&gt;The military - like most employers - are not babysitters. They cannot be expected to remain responsible for individuals outside of their control.

You're arguing past me again. I'm not saying that the military should slot people into jobs and hold their hand and maybe send somebody round to make them dinner or whatever, I'm merely saying that they require psychological support (which you seem to agree with) and some sort of help, probably training, on how to reintegrate with society (which you seem to find abhorrent). 

All I'm calling for is a sort of debriefing process involving courses on time management, organisation and CV writing. Exactly the same sort of thing that you get at University (if you ask at the University Employment office). 

&gt;Civilians are also finding it difficult to find employment regardless of their contact with the military - so there's no good reason that situation should change for an ex-military person.

Unhealthy competition

COMPETITION is now a bigger priority than healthcare when it comes to shaping the NHS in the wake of the 2012 Health and Social Care Act.

The reorganisation of health trusts â and given their financial troubles, many will need it is now subject to the 2002 Enterprise Act, from which only private healthcare companies, and not the NHS, are likely to benefit.

The results have already been seen in Dorset, where in October the Competition Commission rejected the proposed merger of Bournemouth and Poole hospitals, against the wishes of managers and clinicians, after a referral from the Office of Fair Trading, which itself was advised by the health service regulator, Monitor.

Although Monitor is meant to encourage ""cooperation and competition"", its advice drastically favoured the latter. Benefits put forward by the hospitals were dismissed as lacking evidence, and administrative savings were ignored because they ""may be delivered by a merger with an alternative [hypothetical] provider"" â ie a private hospital. The only winners, with fees put at Â£6m, were the lawyers. Outgoing NHS chief executive David Nicholson said the service was now ""bogged down in a morass of competition law"".

Monitor's approach is no surprise. Its chief executive David Bennett was, until 2005, a senior partner at management consultancy McKinsey, whose stock solution is to impose competition and transactions everywhere â even within organisations and often to disastrous effect, as at the BBC, HM Revenue &amp; Customs and, ahem, Enron. Bennett then became chief policy adviser to Tony Blair and head of the Downing Street policy unit until Gordon Brown arrived. He took the Monitor job in 2010.

Alongside him sits Adrian Masters, another McKinsey alumnus who worked for Blair on the market-driven health reforms of 2003, before becoming Monitor's strategy director and working ""to shape the future development of the healthcare sector"". Monitor's ""director of cooperation and competition"", meanwhile, is Catherine Davies, a former city competition lawyer with Linklaters and the Competition Commission itself.

Davies set out her philosophy last year, telling the King's Fund, the health policy think tank, that ""the idea is that [healthcare providers] exert pressure on each other to maintain the quality of services over and above the minimum quality and then whenever they come together, in the absence of other providers who would exert such a pressure, then quality is likely to deteriorate"". In other words, health competition will improve health just as pricing competition reduces prices, even if evidence from the UK and abroad hardly backs this up.

Davies is supported by a ""cooperation and competition"" panel chaired by Lord (Patrick) Carter, serial author of New Labour reviews advocating outsourcing, including one which led to the privatisation of NHS pathology services. When it comes to assessing reorganisations at the OFT, there are no health experts among the lawyers and former mandarins. One director, ex-Monitor boss Bill Moyes, does, however, know about squeezing the NHS. He was a pioneer of the private finance initiative at Bank of Scotland, signing early PFI hospital deals that are now forcing trusts into the red and the restructuring over which the OFT holds sway. Even Lib Dem care minister Norman Lamb has said the OFT's involvement ""should be scrapped"". But since competition as the sole criterion for the structure of health services favours private health companies whose backers are filling Tory party coffers, and in new chief executive Simon Stevens the NHS has a former private health company boss and one-time health adviser to Blair, Lamb is likely to be disappointed.",0,1393084890,null,0,false,0,cfluip3,t3_1ymnuv,t1_cfluip3,t3_1ymnuv,null,1432510186,4,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,4

Most expansion requires different level of investment and ability to execute, and it must be balanced against expected ROI. For example, should an electronics company that started making DVD players expand into selling VCRs? No, it's a declining market, you wouldn't make your money back. But they definitely should have expanded into making Blu-Ray players.

Anyway, I won't go on with this, the important thing is that 'expansion' is not the magic word, it's maximising return on investment.

Glasgow and Edinburgh can be explored easily with trains, trams, the subway or buses.


Glasgow has a heap of great museums, and most of them are free to enter. My favourites:

* Kelvingrove Museum is pretty large, and has a large history/natural history collection along with fine art. 

* The St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art.

* The Provand's Lordship.

* The Hunterian Museum: this is part of the University of Glasgow, which is worth a wander, and has an extensive natural history and mineralogy collection.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; There should be no ""I was lucky to be born here, so I get preference"".

I agree. The problem, is this is not workable in a world with finite resources.

 What about India, or the Chinese? If we're opening our borders to Europe, why not India and China too? Because Europeans were lucky enough to be born in Europe, they're lucky enough to live here. Surely that is wrong and we shouldn't give preference to Europeans over Indians, just as we shouldn't to somebody born in the UK over somebody born in Poland?

The fact is, is that open borders with India or China would have millions upon millions of them coming here. There would not be enough jobs, enough healthcare, enough money, enough resources to go around to support all these peoples whilst maintaing any decent standing of living for ourselves. So why are we doing this in the EU? To me it doesn't make sense if I'm completely honest. 

&gt; The belief that immigrants are coming to this country and are getting jobs in medicine etc. thrown at them is, quite frankly, garbage

I agree and haven't said anything like that at all. 

&gt; they get the jobs because they are **better** than our own,

This is something I disagree with and dislike, and actually slightly infuriates me. If we're to look at what opportunities and what people from Eastern Europe have accepted as normality, it's not hard to understand how such an environment could create an extremely hard working, frugal individual. 

If I had to work on a farm or in a factory for 12hr days, go home to my crumbling 1room flat with intermittent power, shared toilets and not have enough money after bills and food to go out for nice meals, buy nice clothes, acquire new cutting edge electric devices... I'd leave for the UK, France or Germany in a heartbeat. 

Personally, I'd love to go and work my arse off out in the USA and enjoy living in a 5bedroom house in Minnesota, for the same price as a 2up2down here in England. I'd enjoy cheaper costs of living and having more money left over to buy other stuff. So I can completely understand where these immigrants are coming from and the mentality they have. 

However, they would put up with living in bedsits, or many men to a single room as they work every hour god sends to build a life for themselves here. I admire that work ethic and on a personal level have absolutely no problem with these people. If anything, I'd likely get on extremely well with them, share a few beers learning about their country and try to use their motivation to motivate myself. 

But, should we be seen as lazy and selfish for not wanting to live like that ourselves? I don't think we should be, or that we should class these immigrants as better than ourselves such as you suggest. 

&gt; I promote the idea of increasing the opportunities for poorer countries, even at our expense, so they can be on the same level as us 

As do I, I'm honest enough to admit though, that I don't want to decease my quality of life to increase that of others. I rarely give to charity, wouldn't buy a hungry man a meal if he asked me on the street, and believe our house prices and cost of living is fucking extortion as it is. I don't want to see increased costs, and want more disposable income to spend on myself. If you take issue with that, please don't in a hypocritical way. Go out and volunteer your spare time to charity and donate as much as you can afford to charities before you do, or accept the fact you're just like me. 

I'd also like to point out on this point, improvements technologically that humanity makes, increases the quality of life to this day, as it has since the dawn of humanity. Thus, without intentionally sacrificing our quality of life, that of other countries shall continue to raise, albeit remaining behind ours, which isn't a problem for me as mentioned in the previous paragraph. 

&gt; you're not exactly against EU membership, but merely want a British dominance within the EU, am I correct?

If we're to remain in the EU, I simply want us to use our place in the world and the systems we have in place to give us more leverage over policy and for us to have more control over how the EU meets its ultimate goals. For one of the more (arguably most) influential nations, I don't see why we shouldn't? 

&gt; I've constantly been in support of the rise of an opposing left-wing populist movement or, as you term it, a left-wing movement that is very decisive on its aims, and acts as a counterpart.

I try to distance myself from 'left'/'right' wing thinking, and genuinely believe it hinders free thought/common sense. I subscribe to ideas from all political ideologies, but make up my mind up on each situation or event via its own merit, not an ideology I've subscribed to which in effect, does my thinking for me. 

I just can't fucking stand idleness and indecisiveness, especially from those in positions of power. Be that in a working environment or with our governing overlords. ",0,1393090644,null,0,false,0,cflwowp,t3_1ylz5e,t1_cflwowp,t1_cfltsns,null,1432511210,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Of course it was stupid of him, but you can't make sweeping generalizations about a players attitude or work ethic from one ""fuck off"" in a particularly frustrating cup game.  After that all it was going to take was reports of a few too many red cards despite the fact that most people have probably never even seen him play a single game for Blackpool.  The fact is he's been quite impressive when he and the rest of his teammates manage to stay on the pitch.  Just look at the number of red cards Blackpool have received this season, it seems to me that Jacks disciplinary problems seem to be more a product of his environment and his desire to impress while on loan, which is why I think you're spot on for wanting to see what he can do in a team/ league more suited to his and our own style of play.  For all the people lamenting Jack still being on our books while praising Flanno as the ""Scouse Cafu"" (which Flanno deserves to be fair) please just remember that there was a time not too long ago when everyone thought Flanno was too rash with his challenges and that he would never make it here.  Jack is in nearly an identical situation even though from everything I've seen he is much more gifted on the ball and going forward than Flanno.  Again your point of him being a more modern fullback is spot on.

Stockbridge Tap for something similar in Stockbridge.

Golf Tavern for a sunny day and sports.

If you stay out in Leith I like The Links Tavern for a match or a quick pint. 

Brew Dog and Hanging Bat are great for drinks, late nights, and loud noise but not what I think of as a pub. They can be a wee bit ""hip"" (especially Brew Dog) for me to call them a favourite, but definitely worth checking out for some unique beers.

For visiting folks it might be a good idea to check out the Abottsford for an Edwardian feel in city centre.

I like the Cambridge for a small group to centrally grab drinks and chat.

I also like The Steading outside of town near the Pentlands for a country pub feel and a good meal.

In the opening 10 minutes it was all Morecambe, but a deflected Connolly shot meant Oxford were the ones who took the lead on 13 minutes. For then until half time Oxford grew into the game and it was fairly even, Barry pulled off a great save to stop it from becoming 0-2 thankfully. 

After half time Jimbo's team talk seemed to have done it again, we came out brilliantly and I thought we would end up winning it, but Oxford were great defending and our finishing wasn't the best (as always).

If you want a good, specific dark one then look out for Old Peculiar, it's one of the few dark ones I like and it's fairly common up north, I assume it's findable in London too. Don't have too many though, it's a strong one.

One thing to note is that southerners usually prefer their ale poured without the sparkler (a nozzle on the pump), which means it is slightly fizzy. If you travel around then see if you can notice the difference.

Sir,

Britain is the worldâs seventh largest economy and yet people are going hungry.

Half a million people have visited foodbanks in the UK since last Easter and 5,500 people were admitted to hospital in the UK for malnutrition last year.

One in five mothers report regularly skipping meals to better feed their children, and even more families are just one unexpected bill away from waking up with empty cupboards.

We often hear talk of hard choices. Surely few can be harder than that faced by the tens of thousands of older people who must âheat or eatâ each winter, harder than those faced by families whose wages have stayed flat while food prices have gone up 30% in just five years.

Yet beyond even this we must, as a society, face up to the fact that over half of people using foodbanks have been put in that situation by cut backs to and failures in the benefit system, whether it be payment delays or punitive sanctions.

On March 5th Lent will begin. The Christian tradition has long been at this time to fast, and by doing so draw closer to our neighbour and closer to God.

On March 5th we will begin a time of fasting while half a million regularly go hungry in Britain. We urge those of all faith and none, people of good conscience, to join with us.

There is an acute moral imperative to act. Hundreds of thousands of people are doing so already, as they set up and support foodbanks across the UK. But this is a national crisis, and one we must rise to.

We call on government to do its part: acting to investigate food markets that are failing, to make sure that work pays, and to ensure that the welfare system provides a robust last line of defence against hunger.

Join us at www.endhungerfast.co.uk.""

true,I_Am_Indifferent,null,null,"To be honest, Newcastle Brown is more historically important than a must-try beer these days, especially if your palate is used to modern American craft brews. The same could be said of many of the most famous British ""classics"" such as Bass pale ale (which Garrett Oliver of Brooklyn brewery cites as the beer that inspired him to start brewing while he was studying over here in his youth, when US craft beer basically didn't exist) or the output of Samuel Smith brewery (whose Imperial Stout is credited with reviving the style when it had basically disappeared, and single-handedly introduced it to the US via bottled imports.)

These are decent enough beers, and best sampled as close to the brewery as possible, but mainly of interest to those who want to learn about where the modern styles came from; compared to the more powerful versions of these styles which have come out of the American craft movement, they may seem rather quaint and bland.

In recent years there's been a huge increase in the number of microbreweries in the UK, young start-ups inspired in no small part by the US craft ""revolution"". Beers from the likes of Thornbridge, Kernel, or Magic Rock (to name just the first ones that spring to mind) might be more up your street.

I'm a bit out of touch with things these days, and can only really recommend pubs in my own stomping ground of West Yorkshire (haven't been to London in years, and my experiences there have been hit-or-miss) but, as well as trying to get hold of a CAMRA guide as others have suggested, try looking through some blogs such as [this one](http://thebeerboy.blogspot.co.uk/) to get some ideas of what to look out for, and where to look for it.

(the blog I linked to is primarily concerned with bottled beers, but has loads of links to other blogs in the side bar and seemed like a good starting point to explore the British scene - like I said, I haven't been keeping up to date with things recently so can't be much more specific, but if you start clicking around from there you'll find lots of interesting stuff.)

The UK has a lot to offer an ale-lover, but I often worry that, when someone comes over from abroad with high expectations, they'll walk into the first pub they find and have their hopes dashed by a boring, flat, poorly-kept ""traditional"" pint.

From the point-of-view of the establishment, they believe the ""scroungers"" tag when applied to the poor is literally true.  This is because they see those people of adding nothing to society at all, and the fact they have any maintenance cost (however small) is proof of ""scrounging"".

The banker payouts?  Well they're justified in order to provide cheap mortgages for the middle classes to drive-up house prices and firmly cement a socioeconomic wall that'll take hundreds of years to erode.

The battleground in these attitudes is the Class With No Name.

The conservatives were aiming to fit a new type of EM catapult because steam catapults would be difficult to retro-fit into the QE class as they are diesel-electric rather than nuclear powered - so would require a separate steam generator system in order to fit a catapult:arrestor wire system (which is not something that can easily be chucked in without thought). Nuclear carriers generate steam as part of their power production process, but the diesel electric generators on the QE class do not work this way. However, it turned out the EM catapult project in the US was over schedule and over-cost, required a complex export license and our carrier would effectively be the guinea pig for it. The whole thing turned out to be a big non-starter so they had to make a U-turn for the F35B. Doing so also made it more practical to keep both carriers. 

Now the F35B is one of the most misunderstood aircraft projects out there. The arguments between the F35B and C models are largely academic and for people far smarter than us to debate. But really to some extent for our navy it doesn't really matter whether we have 5th generation STOVL fighters or Cat/Trap fighters... its more important that we have **something rather than nothing**. In many respects the F35B reminds me a lot of the Eurofighter Typhoon... slated by the media for years as being delayed and over-budget, but its actually gone on to be a very reliable backbone of our air force.

Opting for a non-nuclear fuel source in the carriers is what made them affordable and quick to build. Nuclear was never a practical option. Our expertise in naval nuclear technology relates to submarines, not surface ships. To give you an idea of the differences between a submarines nuclear reactor and a carriers; a submarines reactor is a bit like the nuclear equivalent of a camp fire, whilst the carrier based equivalents are more like a volcano. They require huge land based facilities to maintain and hundreds of experienced crewmen. Building up the expertise to construct and maintain 2-3 nuclear carriers would have increased the cost by an order of magnitude or more... just not worth it for us. Above all that, our navy fundamentally disagrees with US naval doctrine that nuclear reactors are useful on large surface ships. The RN argue that the US carriers are still dependent on regular supply and replenishment of other items and can only operate in a fleet made up primarily of non-nuclear surface vessels like frigates and tankers. In effect the benefits of having a reactor on a submarine are wasted on a large capital ship... the US Navy disagrees largely because of 'economy of scale' due to the number of carriers they operate, makes the cost of nuclear carriers much more practical. Much of the cost is in the initial investment which is prohibitive if you only plan to build 2-3. If you plan to build 12 then it's another matter entirely.

**Tl;dr**: Despite all the hoo-haa about it, in 5 years time we'll have the most advanced aircraft carrier on the planet, flying the most advanced naval fighter in the world, the largest most advanced ships the RN has ever possessed and all at a pretty decent price considering what the US invests, and the troubles the French have had trying to build a nuclear carrier of their own. Yes... it is over-budget, but that is partly a structural problem with defense purchasing and partly due to the governments U-turn over the aircraft. It isn't actually as over-budget as many thought it would be.

American Hustle: joyful fun nonsense with great outfits and mainly bad hair with little substance but enjoyable nonetheless. August: Osage County, oh my god, kill me now. Great performances, Julia Roberts' character reminded me of someone in my family. Enders Game, entertaining space/alien thing, not deep, easy watch. Enough Said, last film made before the Sopranos Gandlofini passed away, 'nice' film, not sickly sweet for a rom-com, really great performance from the lady from Seinfeld. Senna: already discussed, loved it. White House Down: terrible, awful, awful action film. So bad that it's good, you have to watch it to see how bad an action film can be, so many cliches lols. Blue Jasmine: awful. No redeeming features whatsoever. I suspect I will never like a Woody Allen film. I'd forgotten he'd made it until I found myself loathing it halfway through. Only redeeming feature is copious amounts of alcohol.

Added to that last night I watched About Time, time-travelling rom-com, again not too sickly sweet and really quite lovely, I'd forgotten how much I love Bill Nighy and then I watched Nebraska, road-trip film, dude's elderly father thinks he's won $1m and he humours him with a very long road trip, encountering all sorts of fuckwits en route (including family). Entertaining, a bit moving, good watch, quite funny (mother standing over a grave flashing her knickers at what her dead boyfriend could've had if he hadn't talked about corn so damn much).

Today: Gravity. It's alright. Sandra Bullock has a fit arse and pixie hair suits her. Great CGI. Terrible dialogue. Cringy ending. And Only Lovers Left Alive, review posted on IJW.",0,1393098807,null,0,false,0,cflzw99,t3_1ymnxe,t1_cflzw99,t1_cflzqdj,null,1432512788,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

It's a very clever game, just watch out for those fucking tornadoes.

Phil Hammond and David Davis seem to be decent sorts, but neither of them appears to be exerting much influence over anything.

Exactly the same dismissals could apply to most of the Labour front-bench, my disdain isn't partisan.

The whole problem is that the two big parties (and now the Lib Dems) are essentially sleepwalking down the Neo-Liberal path Margaret Thatcher charted and Tony Blair paved - their disagreements are all over trifling details, neither of them actually presents a vision for the country, good **or** bad.

In that regard, it's easy to see why UKIP's common sense, stands to reason etc etc approach is appealing.

As teamnewg said there will probably be a lot of them telling you about stuff on the course. They probably allow some time for you to ask questions about things you are unsure on so I'd recommend you prep some questions on stuff that can't be found out so easily on websites and brochures (what does the typical timetable look like, ratio of practical work to theory etc).

I'm quite surprised at 90 minutes, is that definitely a solo interview or is it maybe partially in a group? Maybe they take all applicants on a tour of the facilities first and then take you aside individually for 10-15 minutes to do a more personal interview after the tour. I only say this because this has been the format for lots of interviews I've been to in medicine/science areas.

In case it is that bad try to remain calm and engaged, if they say something that peaks your interest then push them for more information and find out as much as you can, it is also to your benefit to find out more as well as trying to look like a good applicant.

I'm not sure whether it'll be treated differently when your previous passport has expired, but I expect that you'll just apply as though you'd lost your previous unexpired passport.

It's a bit more hassle than getting a renewal because you have to get your photos signed again, but I think you have to do that for your first adult passport anyway.

true,ctesibius,cnty-uk,"Reading, Berkshire","I think what you mean is that you want a cull on tax exemptions for non-profit organisations. A charity is a charity, whether or not it has special legal status.

Ok, but why do these things have tax-free status? Let's take the first one you object to - religious foundations. I hope you already know that any employee (for instance a minister of religion) already pays income tax in the normal way - I mention this because it's often misunderstood. So no individual can get untaxed income by this route. That's not the purpose.

Imagine for a moment that churches are taxed on their income, then the people they pay are also taxed. So a member of the congregation puts Â£1000 in to church funds, but the govt takes  say Â£300 of that, and then taxes the minister who is paid out of the remainder. Obviously everyone involved is then better off if they give money as a personal donation directly to the minister. The minister still has to pay income tax on most of these gifts. The church can't be taxed, since it has never received the money - this is just a load of individual donations. However the individuals no longer have any picture of the overall accounting. How much was the overall contribution? 

This is the point of a non-profit charity. It's a way of grouping together donations which individuals would otherwise make individually, and allowing a robust means of accounting and reporting to the individuals without imposing an *additional* tax burden. It's not (with the scandalous exception of the OP's examples) a way of taking a business, and removing the existing tax burden from it.",0,1393102571,null,0,false,0,cfm1d4c,t3_1ym5qi,t1_cfm1d4c,t1_cflxhtf,null,1432513479,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The amount of horrible passes me makes has hit critical mass this year, whilst he still has some quality, he only tends to show it once every 6 weeks or so.

Osman gets a lot of stick, but this season he has shown more composure on the ball, better passing and more threat in the final third than Pienaar now.. Maybe now it is contract season again he will show up, but I don't really believe there is much to show up any more.

I hope next season that Oviedo can fit into his position- he is better going forward, and as a natural defender he will be able to do the gritty work in the defensive third that Pienaar is good at.

Chelsea were incredibly lucky against a great Everton side, and their defence looked slow and unresponsive, so I look forward to their visit to Anfield. I think we have a great chance. Likewise, Southampton lacked confidence and ambition, so now might be the best moment to play them and get a win. 

Man City looked fairly decent against a stoic Stoke, but since both Dzeko and Negredo looked fresh out of ideas and extremely indecisive, it proves more than ever that Aguero really is their main hope of getting a consecutive win-streak in the final games. Man United, on the other hand, really made use of Palace's strange ""stand off and wait"" tactics, but still looked about as lethal in front of goal in open play as my nan; it took a stupid foul in the box to finally undo Palace, who themselves were pretty poor in almost all areas of the pitch.

Taking your theory sooner will drill into you the rules of the road, I believe everybody on the road with an L plate should have at least passed a theoretical but that's something different.

At the same time, practicing the module one procedures in a car park will teach you how to improve on your slow speed control in a comparable way.

If you pick up some cones or use something to mimic cones in a carpark and do your slalom into figure of 8 thingy with the correct distances, and you're struggling, then you will struggle on your actual test meaning you're not up to the standard all riders are expected to uphold.

Full license tests aside, you can look up reading material, Twist of the Wrist is a popular recommendation. You can also look up UK specific advanced motorcycling communities and their learning material, apparently a lot of what you'll find between each one is the same but there's also some subjective material in there, you need to soak up what you can and apply what appropriate material you've learned to your riding.

In respect of advocacy: if by this you mean parliamentary lobbying, I'm in favour of this although I can see some down sides. At the moment, lobbying can be done by (taxable) businesses and by non-taxable organisations which are usually composed of citizens with some particular shared interest. The govt is trying very hard to remove the tax-free status of the latter: if you lobby Parliament, you will have to pay tax. However as far as I can tell, lobbying expenses for a business are a cost to the business in the same way as the cost of employees. By reducing the company's profit, it implies that they pay less tax. The effect seems to be that the company does *not* pay tax on the part of its income used to pay lobbyists, while the citizen organisation *will* be compelled to pay tax on the same. Perhaps a tax specialist can comment on this.

Here's something for you which will open your eyes at just how bad our position is. 

In the last 17 games Chelsea have scored only 6 goals after making substitutions and 3 of those were in 1 game. That is the number of goals scored by anyone on the pitch after the subs are made regardless of us making defensive or offensive subs or what time and reason those subs were for.

1) John Obi Mikel came on a sub and someone else scored a goal after it.

2) Ashley Cole was replaced by Azpi due to injury in first half and someone scored in the second half.

3) Willian replaced SchÃ¼rrle and Chelsea scored 3 against Southampton.

4) Bardsley scores an own goal for Sunderland when we put on Mikel for Mata.

That is our total in the last 17 games. I know Jose's style is to settle games early and prefer defensive play at the end of the game but in these 17 games we desperately needed goals against Southampton (finally won), WBA (D), West Ham (D), Arsenal (D) , Sunderland (finally won after they scored the own goal) and also squeezed by on 1-0 wins in 5 matches.

Now this isn't Jose's fault because I think we have unloading problems in the striking department and I honestly believe that the club has already found a replacement for the summer but until then I really hope we can give this way a shot even if it is for 10 minutes because every single time Eto'o has gone off for us or has played bad we have been hopeless in these situations.",0,1393104867,null,0,false,0,cfm29to,t3_1ynasl,t1_cfm29to,t1_cfm1jxy,null,1432513907,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

That said I'd suggest a bigger bike like a Kawasaki ninja 250. BUT since you're over 24 you can do your full bike test and ride any CC.

So, it sounds like a 500-600cc bike is your sweet spot. Reasonable fuel economy, enough power to stay relaxed on the motorway and enough weight for the stability. Preferably an upright bike as sport bikes can hurt your back after a while.

A Honda CB500 could be picked up for under a grand, an they're reliable enough. Not the prettiest bike but definitely fits the bill.

Another option would be an older Suzuki SV650. Very popular and reliable bikes that can be had cheap enough.

Personally I'd say you get what you pay for. My first bike (125cc) was Â£1,750 and I wouldn't have changed it for the world. I got a real bargain there I think.

When you lower the budget you're looking at older bikes, and then it is important to check for service history and any potential damage.

Don't forget to add the costs of the lessons and tests. As far as I can remember, the two tests add up to around Â£85. Lessons depend on where you go. Personally I'd recommend aintree motorcycle training. Maybe give them a call and have a chat about licenses and bikes.

The only times we have tried it that I can recall (vs. Juventus under Di Matteo and against United at Old Trafford) I have not been convinced. Those 2 situations are interesting as well. Di Matteo's decision was widely interpreted as being because our strikers were literal shite, iirc (forgive me if I'm wrong on this, but I don't like to think about that match much), and Mourinho's was seen as a more defensive move.

I'd be interested in seeing it tried again - but what situation would be good to try it in? You're talking in the context of needing a goal here, and it's certainly true that our midfielders can give us that, but those situations are hardly the time to be experimenting...

The strength behind the 'going 2 up front' move is that 2 strikers can occupy the centre halves more than 1, causing a bit more chaos, leading to more opportunities - though having 4 attacking midfielders would certainly amount to that as well.

I would definitely prefer it to just Torres/Ba replacing Eto'o when we're needing a goal. For a start, that move is counter-intuitive, and I'm not much of a fan for like for like substitutions anyway. One of the many great things about Jose is that he rarely makes a pointless change, and he is not afraid to make risky tactical decisions.

That seems to be the argument put forward by a lot of people. Personally, I think that society could benefit from unemployed people, if they were encouraged to use their time wisely. People that want to make music or art, to volunteer for charities, run social centres, things like that. 

We have so many unemployed people that are being made to feel like shit, and it's not doing anyone any good. We are entering an era where automatisation is taking a lot of the jobs away, and yet we still expect people to look for full time jobs where they simply create profit for the already rich, and if they can't find it, or don't want to, we blame them for our problems.

There is so much unfulfilled potential in our society, if we would only nurture it.
