edit - the article has since been changed again, I had used what now reads as ""Young unemployed people who refuse to take training courses to gain key skills could lose benefits under a Labour government, Ed Miliband says"" for the original title, I can't really help it if they change the wording after I've posted.

Most younger people do not receive Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit either (as they tend to live with their parents) so the money spent on them is relatively tiny.

But the young are an easy target and it appeals to older voters. They see their children still living at home into their 20s, with poor job prospects and a worthless university education and want to shift blame away from themselves. It is easier to stigmatize young people as lazy or stupid rather than accept that the UK education system (from primary to university) is appalling, the companies they own shares in have outsourced most entry level work and even if a young person could get a job decent housing is virtually unaffordable.

I'm not sure how you're not getting this, so I'll make it simple. MUSLIM NO LIKE JEW!

You're speaking as if a certain strict criteria of involvement or culpability has to be met *before* a terrorist will take the apparently well reasoned and thought out action of blowing themselves and hundreds of innocent people up. It's *terrorism*! 

Saying, oh well their involvement was *limited* is so dumb I can't even begin to break it down. The notion that terrorists are sitting in some room agonising over the minutia of troop numbers and movements, rules of engagement, number of days present etc. They're terrorists. You yourself are proposing a rather scatter-gun approach to their methodology but on this point you're clear they are suddenly razor sharp about their reasoning.

What's stopping them from setting bombs or even just ploughing straight through pedestrians outside a football game? Before kick off there are often thousands on the streets. What's stopping them massacring revellers on a weekend? Nothing. The police wouldn't be able to react quick enough and you simply can't defend against things such as this. The IRA certainly didn't blow up planes in the sky - those bastards would blow up streets, hotels and things like the BBC.

Even if they did all of this - never surrender, or they really do win. It's corny, but it's true.

It's just a shame that any threat to us is mainly blowback from our leaders fucking around in foreign affairs for decades.

What I will say is that we couldn't go on borrowing willy-nilly forever. It just wouldn't work and so cuts had to be made. Of course, those cuts are going to cause problems, but they are problems due to increased public spending in past years. We need to be more efficient with the smaller amount of money we have if the UK is ever to get rid of it's debt.

In my opinion, I would have cut more and in more places, not letting anything be ring-fenced because if the debt gets too high, and we can't keep up with it, the consequences will be far worse than what you've linked above.

Some convictions would become spent under the terms of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, and cautions are spent straight away, so you can't ask about them unless you're recruiting for an exempt post (and, when insurers ask, the Ombudsman sayeth [""If firms insist on asking questions about spent convictions, then they must effectively ignore the answers they receive. Otherwise, we are likely to consider they have breached their statutory duty.""](http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/publications/ombudsman-news/25/25-disclosure-of-spent-motoring-convictions.htm))

Currently, everything remains on PNC until such time as you reach 100; which is less of an issue than people think (notwithstanding the recent case regarding disclosure), but the retention of that data isn't the argument - the argument is who should be allowed to see it, and when should you be required to disclose it?

Germany, for example, seal an individual's file at 18 regardless of what they've committed (which includes murder, iirc) and prohibit the use of conviction data for making recruiting decisions.

true,terahurts,eng-lincolnshire,"Cleethorpes, definitely not Grimsby","I'm in my early 40's, here's a few thoughts/observations.

I remember rolling blackouts in the 70s, and eating my dinner by candle light because someone somewhere was on strike.  And Maggie taking my free school milk away.

My parent's paid £4500 for their house in '71.  That's ~£56k in today's money.  I bought it off my dad in 2001 for £100k and sold it five years later for £140k.

When I went to Uni had a 50/50 grant-loan split.  My total debt including loan and overdraft was ~£8000 in the mid-90's.  My daughter will have something like £30k's worth when she finishes next year.

Getting a job in the 90s and early 00s was pretty much a case of sending my CV off and having an interview.  The longest I was unemployed between '95 and '06 was for one month.

We didn't have the world at our fingertips.  If we wanted to look something up it meant opening a book, which probably meant a trip to the library if it wasn't in a book you owned.  If you wanted to write a letter, you needed a pen and some paper.  If you wanted to order something it meant flipping through a paper catalogue and then waiting a few weeks.  Looking at the toys in the back of the winter edition Kays/Littlewoods/Freemans catalogues is an enduring memory (as is the underwear section when I hit my teens....).

Talking on the phone cost money.  Not a huge amount, but - for me at least - phone calls consisted of 'Hey! meet me down the park at 6'.  Early mobile phones cost a fortune, no bundled minutes or texts, no MMS, no internet.   

TV: Three channels.  Don't like sport and it's Saturday afternoon?  Tough shit, go outside or read a book or something.

The Cold War.  I had nightmares about the bomb dropping almost all the way through my teens.

So, overall I'd say that though things were different, they were just as shit/no shit but in different ways.  Huge student debts, high unemployment and insane property prices but at least you're not terrified that Russia is going to nuke your mum and dad.  You've got (almost) free access to petabytes of information quite literally in your pocket, you don't need to be in the same room, let alone the same country to chat with your mates and power cuts are the result of weather not industrial action.

I do feel that the shitness of the country is vastly overstated. I'm a lifelong liberal (with a small 'L') and would never vote for the Tories in a million years, however I think for a lot of young people they see the current administration as their battle. Their Thatcher, even. It's laughable in a way, because Cameron is nowhere near as bad. What is it about the social media generation, where everything must be turned into an Upworthy-style absolute? I feel that some young people - whether Tumblr SJWs or try-hard political activists - want everything they do to be part of this enormous battle of good vs evil. It's all about the jump to hysteria, and is ridiculous. The world is not black and white.

When you get even a little bit older, you will be acutely embarrassed at how seriously you took everything, and about how self-righteous you were. I've done my bit for social causes: I co-founded a non-profit when I was in my early 20s, I spent ages arguing with people about religions and belief systems. It's all kind of irrelevant now though - you do a lot of growing up in your 20s.

I think the younger generation has a right to feel cheated - the economic collapse has ruined a lot of opportunities for them (I graduated in 2008 just before it got bad but it still wasn't a picnic). In some respects I think the older generations need to stop, listen and take them seriously.

Yes things are more expensive than they used to be, but everyone thinks that due to inflation. If there were some things that I would tell the older generations though:

* Housing is vastly more expensive now. We are approaching crisis point and most people of my generation will not be able to buy a house, especially those who live in London. Society - and pensions especially - are still built around the idea that when you're old you'll own your own place and not have rent to pay. We are in trouble here.

* The job market is in tatters. Nobody older than me believes how difficult it is to get a job - they talk about applying to a few you like, interviewing for a few, getting a couple of offers and then picking one they want. I was unemployed all of 2012, despite an Oxford degree and four years of relevant work experience in my field. I applied for 300 jobs and got 4 interviews. I only got the job I'm in now because the person reviewing CVs refused to dump half of them as requested by her boss - she read every single one and picked me out. There were over 1000 applicants for 5 positions (and it's not a great job). When I see a young person struggling to get work I don't think that they're lazy, or need to grind some more in unpaid internships. I see people whom society has badly let down, and I have a ton of empathy for them

* Everything is not shit. Everything is better than it was. The Internet has made communication and business infinitely easier, crime is lower, the standard of living is clearly better than it was a couple of decades ago. Racism and sexism are now frowned on in society, to the point where people who are routinely racist and sexist feel persecuted. The irony! 

* Immigration is changing this country and while that isn't a bad thing at all, I do understand why it makes people feel uncomfortable to see their country change so rapidly and irrevocably. I think there's a lot more needed to do in terms of integration in many parts of the country. But here's the thing: I work in an office with a strong international bent. We have maybe 15 nationalities - from Greek and Polish to Dutch and Chinese. It's brilliant. You learn so much, you have such a good time. The other month we celebrated King's Day, a Dutch holiday, and everyone in the office wore orange and then got drunk at a Dutch pub. I love that.

* Things were just as bad when you were growing up. You might only remember the good bits but it's true. Music isn't worse, TV isn't worse, films aren't worse, culture isn't worse. Yeah the 60s had the Beatles and the Stones and a bunch of other amazing bands besides, but they also had *thousands* of terrible bands that nobody remembers now. There's more attention on every band now - thanks to the Internet - but the dross-to-quality ratio is much the same, if you ask me

Train operators should run some services at a loss, in order to provide regular and useful services that encourage people to use trains because they're accustomed to being able to use them for their journeys. But with rising passenger numbers it doesn't look like there's a problem with people not using the railways.

The service in question is a proposed direct service from Shrewsbury (pop. 100,000) to London. Currently they have to change at Birmingham New Street.

It would be better for the people of Shrewsbury to have a direct service to London, but there's little reason to take a loss on that one. Rework the proposed times or wait until traffic volumes would make a service profitable.

To some extent the profitable routes already subsidies the unprofitable ones. The current franchising system leads to more profitable franchises paying extra and unprofitable ones receiving subsidies, and underlying all this are massive government payments to Network Rail to help maintain the tracks, signals, bridges and tunnels.

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"I think that, mid-long term, the outlook is somewhat bleak for a number of reasons, the first being the most significant.

1)  Cheap energy is at an end.  Western society from say 1910 to the mid 2000's was predicated on the fact that oil was basically infinite in supply and $20 a barrel.  It now costs $100+, and it needs to stay there in order that extracting oil from shales, deepwater and subsalt remains profitable.  This means that driving, heating, eating and many other processes which are contingent on oil will start to cost a lot more over the next couple of decades.  It's impossible to overstate how big a deal this is.  All human activity, economic and otherwise, relies on the availability of energy.  When that energy becomes harder to get, things get very difficult.

2)  The lack of cheap energy has significant economic implications.  The present debt finance model assumes that energy is plentiful and cheap and that continual exponential growth is possible.  If that stops being the case, economic assumptions break down and the debt finance model we use runs into real trouble.

3)  When we start to have less cheap energy, we can do less economic stuff, since we have to focus on eating and heating.  This harms the economy.  It's why I don't really believe the present 'recovery' is real or sustainable.  Unemployment is still high, poverty is getting worse, and I expect these trends to continue long term, globally.  This will also impact the ability of governments to provide services, as we're currently witnessing with austerity in much of europe.

4)  Renewables probably aren't all that helpful.  Never, in the history of society, have we transitioned from a more dense energy source (wood &gt; coal &gt; oil) to a less dense energy source (oil &gt; solar/whatever).  There are colossal physical and technical challenges in the switch to renewables which are largely ignored or swept under the carpet in most discussions.  

5)  The global financial system is still incredibly fragile.  It wasn't properly fixed after 2008.  It is an incredibly complex nonlinear system which is very vulnerable to systemic shocks, and there's certainly a chance that in the next 5 or 10 years we could witness a crash that makes 2008 look like a hiccup.

In summary, I think our parents had it good for an incredible number of reasons and I think it's near impossible that we'll enjoy the same benefits and opportunities that they did.

Or just email the Villa ticket office, tell them you're a Villa fan but because you live in Oz you don't have a booking history. You could always try the same with Arsenal but don't know how much look you'd have. 
Have you tried any Australian Arsenal supporters clubs as well? Overseas clubs often get an allocation of tickets for situations such as this, as otherwise fans who lived abroad would have no chance of getting away tickets. Depending how passionate about Arsenal you are, you'll enjoy the whole experience a lot more in the Arsenal end having a sing song with them (although hopefully not celebrating anything). 

Or, ask the Villa ticket office nicely, get yourself a ticket towards the back of the Lower Holte End and we'll see if we can't convert you by the time the 90 minutes are up :)  Presuming you've never been to a Premier League match before, watch it from the Holte and you'll fall in love with us forever...

Wherever you end up sitting, get there in plenty of time for the game, have a wander around the ground and go and take some pics of the Holte End steps. Sadly the old Trinity Road stand is no more but Villa Park is still one of the great traditional stadiums. Go into one of two of the pubs around the ground. Try The Bartons Arms (15 minute walk) before or after as it's one of the most beautiful pubs in Birmingham and will be friendly and not too rammed. Then if you want more rough and ready and to drink with some Gooners head to The Witton Arms right near Villa Park, just make sure to turn right when you go in, away fans will be that side, home fans in a room round the back.

My point is that the problem with uk employment isn't lack of education. We have vastly more of it than we did two decades ago.

Many employers don't really care if a child has spent 12 years in education or 14. They simply want someone who is intelligent, can spell and can do basic maths. They are using educational qualifications to try to bias their chances of getting one. However many of those essential skills are learnt in the first few years of education rather than the last ones. 

What I'm saying is that for many jobs the extra education (AS levels or beyond) don't make candidates more valuable for many jobs. They are simply an extremely expensive way of allowing employers to separate good candidates from bad.

(and yes, I know there are some jobs out there that really do require degree level education. But they are vastly outnumbered by the ones that don't but insist on degrees anyway simply because they can.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;This just makes no sense, the government can't just pay for these costs without raising taxs or cutting in other areas, both of which would be harmful to them.

That doesn't seem to matter. For example the previous government committed us to spend  £6.2 billion on two oversized through-deck cruisers. And the current government have overspent their free school budget by  a factor of 3.

&gt;You mean political parties and individual MPs, they do not equal the government, it might be worth remembering that these talks were started under Labour.

The Labour and Conservative parties are not that dissimilar.

Political parties and their individual MPs usually want to see their party form a government every now and again. Once they form a government they usually want to see some kind of program established. 

It's much easier to win elections and subsequent to get things done with the support of industry, the media and wealthy investors. 

&gt;Is it really so impossible to believe that they don't genuinely think this deal is good for Britain and the world? 

It will have some good and some bad effects. 

&gt; Since it is estimated to add 68-119 billion euros to the EU's GDP by 2027 providing additional annual disposable income of 545 euros for a family of four in the EU and creating millions of jobs.

I doubt very much that it will work out that way. The balance of income between capital and labour has shifted decisively to capital. I'd expect that most of the benefits will accrue to the owners of capital.

In this respect it will be very much unlike the  European Coal and Steel Community  and the EEC. Fortunately these happened during the post war consensus and therefore made nearly everyone better off.

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"&gt; Tories in a million years, however I think for a lot of young people they see the current administration as their battle. Their Thatcher, even. It's laughable in a way, because Cameron is nowhere near as bad. What is it about the social media generation, where everything must be turned into an Upworthy-style absolute? I feel that some young people - whether Tumblr SJWs or try-hard political activists - want everything they do to be part of this enormous battle of good vs evil.

I think that attitude is just the last phase of the teenage rebellion years - every generation has their enemy. But at the same time, as you said, I think a lot of young people have good reason to feel frustrated with the current state of affairs, especially anyone in  education. Although having said that, I've met a few people in my short life that perfectly match your description of wanting everything to be good vs. evil (""any excuse to protest"").

&gt; When you get even a little bit older, you will be acutely embarrassed at how seriously you took everything, and about how self-righteous you were. I've done my bit for social causes: I co-founded a non-profit when I was in my early 20s, I spent ages arguing with people about religions and belief systems. It's all kind of irrelevant now though - you do a lot of growing up in your 20s.

I agree. I've felt a big change in my mentality and awareness since I graduated a few years ago, probably due to age. Although if my Dad is anything to go by, the self righteousness comes back again in later life!

I started uni in 2008 though, so spent the worst part of the economic crisis in uni. The lack of focus and value in education worries me the most. The idea that a lot of places now expect a degree, and they'll only employ people with experience. Anyone with a fresh degree is now in a pickle. Worst thing is it's not the education or knowledge from the degree they value, as a result, if you do a masters or PhD, you could very well end up in an even worse employment situation.

&gt; Everything is not shit. Everything is better than it was. The Internet has made communication and business infinitely easier, crime is lower, the standard of living is clearly better than it was a couple of decades ago. Racism and sexism are now frowned on in society, to the point where people who are routinely racist and sexist feel persecuted. The irony!

I agree to some extent. I think it's an over-generalisation to say that everything is better. We know that e.g. poverty has double in the past 30 years. The ratio of average household income to average house price has taken a turn for the worse. We can speculate the average space available per person has reduced (increased population, smaller houses, subdivision of rooms etc.) But on the flip side, we have the interwebs - and it's in our pockets! We have the option to have nicer/better things, but that doesn't mean those things are available to more or less people though. As someone else commented, I think ones opinion on if life is better/worse than it was is wholly dependant on ones own position within society.

It plays a part but pretending a politician at 50 is going to treat the concerns of youth as seriously as the concerns of OAPs (which he will still be one day) is just delusional.

To an extent politicians change when the personnel change. The same people who moan about being unrepresented climb up the political poles and end up in government. That is as much a part of the process as people deciding they had better start voting.

People like Tony Benn, Enoch Powell, John Prescott, Ken Clarke, etc don't change their minds all that much. What happens is they retire at some point and get replaced by Blair, Brown, Darling, Cameron, Osbourne, etc that better represent the middled aged population. Blair was once a person complaining that Labour were too far to the left and torn apart by factional infighting. Then he became a major player in Labour and played part in fixing that (for definitions of fixing).

true,Unlinkedhorizonzero,,Belfast,"I'm gonna teach you about basic psychology - There is a term given that describes our chain of thought (i'm going to sound like a nutjob but this is all true) - 

Inner locus of Control (bare with me) - It depicts the amount of control we see ourselves as having over our lives, If you don't have a strong inner locus of control it is the main propagator of 100's of physiological conditions and literally causes negative thoughts/schizophrenia/social anxiety/depression also if you have a poor locus of control it can have devastating physical effects like people not being able to move parts of their body and is the main cause of addiction/bulimia/anorexia.

People who are religious don't have a strong inner locus because they go through their lives believing things happen to them because of some devine higher power when in reality it's all them. A lack of an internal control is called having an external locus of control/Blame external factors for their lack of success/state of living/way things turn out for them.

A lot of people don't know how strong this thing fucking is and go through their lives thinking they have serious issues ie depression is a chemical imbalance/a sickness /can't be cured etc 

You never get taught how to manage your thoughts properly growing up and so this results in a lot of people being fucked up mentally.

Stress is the ultimate example of a lack of an inner locus of control - You feel like you don't have control/things aren't going your way and you start to panic. If you think about it in reality and take a step back and look at everything it's not really that bad - 

So recipe for a cure all depression/social anxiety/a lot of major physiological conditions - Broken down into 3 sections 

Self-esteem / Locus of Control / Social Anxiety 

They are all interlinked like 3 leaves on a clover - If you improve one the other two basically get supercharged and the only way to do this is through ding ding ding positive thoughts and experiences

You go through your life wearing your everything is shit spectacles - doom and gloom, the weather outside is depressing, such a shit day, the cold makes me hate everything and everyone - Reality check Rainy weather dosn't make you depressed - you make yourself depressed with negative thoughts i.e. ""rain makes me depressed"" Even one thought like that in your head is enough to ruin your day (that powerful)

You write down every positive experience via a list of 10 recent/not so recent experiences and look for the positive in things - An example would be you went to a bbq today and enjoyed yourself instead of being cooped up in the house with headaches - give yourself a pat on the back and write that down - Keep the list with you all day and look at it once every hour spending like 30 secs on each thing imagining why it was a positive. This thing will literally supercharge your self esteem and has been known to cure people suffering depression all their lives in just 2 weeks. Because guess what Depression is just the accumulation of negative thoughts on repeat in your head.

It can have such a profound effect within the body physically that it has helped people fight cancer and other life threatening diseases - It literally boosts your immune system and white blood cell count and there are 100's of studies to back this up. - Nurses and doctors can more or less tell in children's wards whos going to die because some kids have basically lost the will to live and so they actually do.(harsh but true) If thoughts are strong enough to stop people moving their limbs they are strong enough to do what I just described. (an example would be derren Brown's subliminal message were people were glued to their seat and couldn't move)

So whilst this Tinnitus can be physical with things like ear wax etc it is so profound in your life because you're giving it leeway - thinking about it/ having to ring your GP / worrying about it when in reality it's these things that are making it a million times worse - Just to back this all up last time you were at your birthday/ a key event in your life and your self esteem was at 100% I'm near sure you weren't getting headaches.

So if you really want to help yourself write out the list with these sub headings What made this a positive experience ? - What would you say to someone else who had this experience ? - What does it show you/What have you learned from this ?

It will supercharge your self-esteem, Boost your inner locus of control, Rid you of social anxiety and generally make your Tinnitus go away

Guaranteed results 

If anyone else is reading this it is a skill for life and therefore nothing will ever phase you - Have Cancer, So fuck I'm going to beat this: Family member died - I live on, going to make something of myself etc etc

There are literally 100's xyz et al studies backing this up and a quick search on the internet would prove this.

From 2008 to 2011, we had a service called [Wrexham and Shropshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrexham_%26_Shropshire) which ran from Wrexham to London Marylebone. They were not a franchised service and operated even when making a loss, but in the end they had to stop since there weren't able to afford to do it any more with the loss they were making and lack of profit.

My dad and I took several journeys from Shrewsbury to Marylebone with these people and it was an excellent service. It was very reasonably priced (about £40 return/person). It was spacious inside and the staff were excellent, and was the highest rating railway company in the country, at 99%.
&gt;Those who have used the service have been full of praise, and it scored a remarkable 99% satisfaction rating in an independent survey.

Virgin Trains caused a lot of bother for them by not allowing W&amp;S to go through the ideal route, and then launching a competition service to put the nail in the coffin for W&amp;S before cancelling that service.

&gt; Either way, the town is caught between two battling train companies, each offering to carry the citizens of north-east Wales to London. The contest pits rail-borne David against Goliath. **The upstart takes the form of Wrexham and Shropshire, which began running a new service to the capital last year via a roundabout route. The giant is played by Virgin Trains, which has recently begun running its own rather faster direct service to London**. Wrexham, for all its charms, is not big enough for both. **The suspicion is that Virgin has decided to kill off its impudent rival by running a spoiler service - a cause for alarm in the Welsh Marches, which has come to prize its quirky local train company. It runs without a subsidy - unlike Virgin - and is fighting back with cheap fares on sale at any time, and free kippers for breakfast in first class. A peak-time return ticket to London is £53, against £201 on Virgin**. Now comes news that its big rival plans to target Shrewsbury too, which is another of the little company's stops, by reintroducing a London service that was cut several years ago. Meanwhile the Welsh firm is banned from picking up any Virgin passengers in Birmingham. The contest mirrors one under way on the east coast, where two small companies are challenging National Express. For now, this is good for travellers. But if Virgin wins, the new trains could stop, and Wrexham would end up back on a rusty siding.

- Take a guided tour at anfield.

- Visit Melwood, and take some pictures when they (Players, staff) leave. Really

- Go shopping in LiverpoolOne, allot of good shops, and places to eat.

- Eat at ""Nandos"" @ LiverpoolOne, good chicken franchize, where u might see some young LFC players. (Ive seen Kelly and Adam Morgan there)

- It is allot nightclubs in Liverpool, but so many places are full on a friday/saturday night. So it was a bit much for me, but im not local so dont know so many good nightclubs^^

- I have been to 3-4 diffrent stipclubs in Liverpool, my fav is Dreamers. Google it, its close to many nightclubs. Its much less people and some nights have had some very cute girls dancing (I think, been drunk most time ive been there)

- Enjoy it! Fantastic city, with great people!

The policy chapters on the side go very in depth, so I'd suggest reading the ""Core Values"" and ""Philosophical Basis"" sections linked at the top first. There's a lot of things that I found represented my views a lot more than I expected, certainly in comparison to labour/tories. They would actually make real change.

&gt;[The success of a society cannot be measured by narrow economic indicators, but should take account of factors affecting the quality of life for all people: personal freedom, social equity, health, happiness and human fulfilment.](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/core-values.html)

&gt;[A healthy society is based on voluntary co-operation between empowered individuals in a democratic society, free from discrimination whether based on race, colour, gender, sexual orientation, religion, social origin or any other prejudice.](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/core-values.html)

Edit: relevant to the submission in this thread:

&gt;[The Green Party knows that we are all interdependent and that many people need support at some stage in their lives. The basic aim is that all people should be able to lead an empowered and fulfilled life. We believe that every individual in society has an equal right to food, water, warmth and housing](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/sw.html#SW104)

For one thing they would implement a Citizen's Income

&gt;[A Citizen's Income sufficient to cover an individual's basic needs will be introduced, which will replace tax-free allowances and most social security benefits (see EC711). A Citizen's Income is an unconditional, non-withdrawable income payable to each individual as a right of citizenship. It will not be subject to means testing and there will be no requirement to be either working or actively seeking work.](http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ec.html#EC730)

We are going to have to deal with the major problems of climate change in our lifetime. We may not be able to rely on state pensions when we retire. 

We do have access to great technologies like the internet, and are going to see a lot of technological progress in out lifetimes that will change our lives, hopefully for the better. Personally I can see the future ranging from near utopia where robots do most of the work and we have a universal basic income, to a dystopian nightmare where we are all fighting for limited resources and living space on a world ridden by climate change and conflict. It all depends on how we handle the problems we face now, but sadly I think the latter is more likely. Also since inequality has been rising for decades, coupled with the rising costs of essentials and the future crisis's we face of climate change and fossil fuels running out, I believe it's going to be very bad to be poor in the future but life for the middle and upper classes may get better.",0,1403178407,null,0,false,0,cibiymp,t3_28jb3g,t1_cibiymp,t1_cibh2tn,null,1434307597,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Additionally check out insurance companies that fit black boxes in the car, they may also be cheaper or offer a rebate after so many months careful driving.

When looking at fuel economy, ignore the official stats.  They do not reflect real world driving.  Check out honestjohn.co.uk or Whatcar.co.uk for real world fuel figures on any car you are looking at.  Then work out your monthly/annual fuel budget from that.

The official price for an MOT is £54.  it's set by the government.  Anything below that is a special offer being run by the garage who are paying the difference.

Servicing will probably be around £150 every year.

Given your mileage and assuming your driving style is relaxed you'd need new breaks and tyres every 3 years or so.  Please don't buy the cheapest tyres, they are one of the few things worth paying a bit more for.  The stopping distances between cheap tyres and premium tyres can be as much as 20% different!  Avon's are a good middle of the road brand.  Hankooks also.

As for anything going horrifically wrong, you should try to keep an account with a minimum of £500 in it to take care of anything going horribly wrong.

Lastly do some armchair haggling with the AA or RAC and get yourself some breakdown cover.  Should be around £30-£40 per year and it's worth having.

I've been to see Costa play live 6 times, he scored and was in full beast mode in 5 of these games, the only game he didnt score in was his debut for Spain v Italy. **He is exactly the type of striker we need**, I've said this since October so you can only imagine how annoying it is to hear fellow fans bashing the signing even though in reality they have no idea about him.

The 'he doesnt suit Spains system' argument is extremely valid because its true. He **DOES NOT** suit their system. I seen him play twice in the space of 10 days, on the same pitch but with Spain in the first game. He was a shadow of the player that turned up V Espanyol a week later.

Saying 'he has only had one good season' is so fucking annoying also. Would you go back and unsign Drogba because he only had one good season before joining us? Yeah, thats what I thought.

I also seen comments last night along the lines of 'this year he will be coming up against packed defences in the Premierleague, he didnt have to deal with that playing for Atleti' If you said this, please shut up! You clearly dont watch La Liga so stop commenting.

He is going to sign for Chelsea, get on board with it. Keep your judgments until next summer when you have actually seen him play a full season of football. Jose wants him, he sees him as the perfect player to lead our line and the last time I checked he knows a little bit more about football than any of us.

In their defense though, they claim the founders of the party were white supremacists, a cursory glance at the Wikipedia entry suggests they might well be correct - or at least the connection isn't that much of a stretch. 

&gt;The Sweden Democrats were founded on 6 February 1988[29][third-party source needed] as a successor to the Sweden Party, which in turn had been founded in 1986 by the merger of the racist organisation Bevara Sverige Svenskt (BSS, English: Keep Sweden Swedish) and a faction of the xenophobic and populist Progress Party.[30] The roots of the party can be found in Swedish fascism. One of the party's early chairmen, Anders Klarström, was formerly active in the Nazi Nordiska rikspartiet (Nordic Reich Party).[31][32] The party was characterized initially by right-wing extremism and activism. In 1999 they rejected Nazism,[30] although SD's long used logo in the 1990s and to 2006 was a Swedish version of the NF torch.[30] While opinion on the early SD vary, it is generally agreed (including by the Swedish Committee Against Antisemitism and Expo) that the SD has never been a Nazi party, although various ""connections"" have existed through their members.

Some things have got better, and some worse. 

**On the good side:**

* There's a lot less racism, homophobia and sexism about. 

* Travel is much cheaper. 

* The internet has made it easy to connect with the rest of the world, and mobile phones have made it easer to connect with family and friends. 

* There's a better choice of food, restaurants are better and more affordable. 

* There isn't the suffocating social deference which existed in the 1950s. 

* Crime has dropped

* The cold war is over

* There's been a lot more immigration. 

* Things are a lot more child friendly. In the 50s there were all sorts of activities and places you just didn't take your kids to. 

* I don't have to put up with smokers in restaurants any more. 

**On the bad side:**

* Kids don't play outside any more. 

* A nasty divisive rhetoric of ""strivers versus scoungers"" is sweeping the country.

* Unemployment has risen and real wages fallen.

* Houses are much more expensive relative to wages

* University education is much more expensive. 

* There's a lot less decent social housing. 

* There's a lot of paranoia about terrorism. 

* People have those new fangled music players which play that annoying tinny ""c'tssh c'tssh"" noise on the bus or train. 

I wouldn't want to give someone under 25 any practical advice. Things are changing rapidly, I'm out of touch, and who knows what the future will hold? All I can suggest is: travel a lot, talk to everyone, keep your eyes open and use your brain. But you knew that already.

I think we've moved sideways in real terms. There are more people ""employed"" but they might not work every week or get very few hours.

I'll give you an example. I used to work in retail for a large games store to support my self employed income which could vary from month to month. The company was bought by another very large games retailer and 6 months later they realised they had a large hole in the budget after summarily messing up the company they took over.

How did they fix this? Instead of laying people off and paying them redundancy pay they just halved or quartered everyone's hours. The choice you had was to take it or leave it. 

Now the employment figures didn't change because most people just sucked it up but the money in people's pocket took a hit.

&gt;More generally house prices rise because of increases not only in the numbers 
of households but also because of rising incomes and expectations about 
future house price rises, as well as alternative investment opportunities. 
Migrants, as we have shown, are a large part of household growth and their 
demand to live separately increases over time. On the other hand, they generally have lower incomes at least initially. Moreover, especially if they 
remain as tenants, their income elasticity of demand for housing is lower than 
for established households. Therefore their direct effect on house prices is 
likely to be less than established households.

One day he'll give you a Ronaldo or Messi-esque performance the next day he's not interested in the game and. 
For everyone trying to down play his past achievement because of his 2 last World Cup matches should know that he had 8 goals in 580 minutes of play in the Champions league only 2 person out score him Zlatan with 10 in 670 minute and Ronaldo with 17 in 993 minutes ( the kid a freak of nature).

On Fabreagas we really don't know who else were after him, there were numerous report linking him to United, Liverpool, and Chelsea. We acted fast because Mourinho saw him as someone we need. No one should say United wasn't intrested in him because every club say that to save face in case they're beaten to the player signature by another club. Fab is a great player and we made a very intelligent purchase. 

The reason I'm mainly behind these purchases apart from me actually seeing them play in more than 5 game is that they're Mourinho signing not one of Roman The Great (all hail this fantastic man) impulse buy. I trust Mourinho and his staff know what these players are capable of and know a whole lot better than OP and his brigade of supporters. You talking about people using their common sense, why don't you try using yours and taming your inflated ego and stop acting like you know more about this than Mourinho or all these guys who spent their entire life doing this as a means of providing for their family and their family are all eating healthy,

Didn't think about the supporters clubs only sorting home games, maybe try and blag your way through the Villa supporters club then instead.

*Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam, author of Bowling Alone, is very nervous about releasing his new research, and understandably so. His five-year study shows that immigration and ethnic diversity have a devastating short- and medium-term influence on the social capital, fabric of associations, trust, and neighborliness that create and sustain communities.*

*Putnam’s study reveals that immigration and diversity not only reduce social capital between ethnic groups, but also within the groups themselves. Trust, even for members of one’s own race, is lower, altruism and community cooperation rarer, friendships fewer. The problem isn’t ethnic conflict or troubled racial relations, but withdrawal and isolation. Putnam writes: “In colloquial language, people living in ethnically diverse settings appear to ‘hunker down’—that is, to pull in like a turtle.""*

*Diversity does not produce “bad race relations,” Putnam says. Rather, people in diverse communities tend “to withdraw even from close friends, to expect the worst from their community and its leaders, to volunteer less, give less to charity and work on community projects less often, to register to vote less, to agitate for social reform more, but have less faith that they can actually make a difference, and to huddle unhappily in front of the television.”*

*In general, they find that the more people are brought into contact with those of another race or ethnicity, the more they stick to their own, and the less they trust others. Putnam writes: “Across local areas in the United States, Australia, Sweden Canada and Britain, greater ethnic diversity is associated with lower social trust and, at least in some cases, lower investment in public goods.”*

To say they're the ""biggest far-right threat remaining in Britain"" is completely insane in light of the Al-Muhajiroun/Islam4UK and other Anjem Choudary groups that are still operating to some extent. 

&gt; On the streets of east London Paul Golding told Channel 4 News that if Islamic extremists did not exist, then his vigilante-style group would not be on the streets.

This is mostly true, the EDL wouldn't exist if the government had taken action after the 2009 Wootton Bassett protests, their further inaction has only worsened the scene and has led to the rise of other groups like Britain First.

The closest comparable situation we in recent history is the War of Irish War of Independence and civil war that followed (and to an extent the troubles terrorist actions in northern Ireland) where it's basically impossible to pick apart religious, cultural and political issues. I can't tell you off the top of my head if any foreign nationals went to fight but I do know for a fact that large sums of money was raised by Irish Americans to help fund the early stages of what (I believe) the American state considered to be an illegitimate government. 

Maybe there is a problem inherent in Islam, I'm not one to simply rule it out but really there's nothing happening here that is at all strange historically speaking and so I feel if you are seeing anything it's much more likely to be expressions of problems with religion as a whole than anything in particular. Blind faith is simply a powerful tool of control that is easy to manipulate and so anyone looking for an edge, personally, socially or politically will seek for ways to exploit it because it makes people willing to exploit themselves.

true,PopeGregoryIX,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"&gt; Instead, perhaps politicians could investigate why people don't vote.

Why would they? They don't need the youth vote so why go chasing after it? 

Obviously there is no way to prove second_per_second's theory, it being entirely hypothetical, but if you look at current trends it's pretty clear that parties will shape their policies to fit around the people that are most likely to vote (i.e. the elderly) rather than the other way round. 

From a different angle, if fewer people are interested in politics, there is a smaller pool from which politicians are drawn and consequently a narrowing of policies. You talk of a political party of science and reason, and, in fact, there is nothing stopping you from forming such a party yourself. 

Why don't you? Why doesn't someone else? Because the sort of people you would be trying to appeal to do not vote. If they did, maybe more people would see politics worthwhile. 

Maybe. Don't ask me to prove it. 

One last thing:

&gt;that's an issue with the politicians and their approach and does not, in any way, represent a responsibility or obligation for those that don't vote.

So, to paraphrase: ""Democracy is not the responsibility of the people"". You know we're the ones who decide who even gets to be a politician, right? You think they're just going to magically sort out their attitude without anyone telling them to do it? 

""Hey, my attitude and actions are considered unacceptable by a group of people whose opinion I neither hear about nor care about! I'd better change my ways so that some people who (I assume) already don't like me might be more interested in deciding whether or not I have a job!""

true,Melberger,null,null,"David played a key role in Spain's success at Euro 2008 and Euro 2012, he's been a big part of their success.

This was however his first real opportunity to put his mark on a World Cup. Del Bosque started him in Spain's opening game in the 2010 World Cup, but dropped him from the starting lineup after they suffered a shock loss - in order to tweak the team and have a more direct outlet in the form of Pedro. They could only have so many creators, and unfortunately David was the one to make way.

It's a real shame because he was trusted fully at this World Cup, and was given a prominent role against Chile yesterday. Del Bosque placed a lot of trust in him playing him in a number 10 role while Iniesta played on the left.

And the truth is, he didn't play that well.

He tried and put in the hard yards, but he struggled given how aggressive the Chileans were and how crowded it was in their central areas. He was often outmuscled, and often pressured into playing a safe pass.

Iniesta had the better game, and looked more of a threat when he was in that central area.

I think in that kind of game David is more suited to playing on the flank with a bit less pressure on the ball and then drifting centrally. He can struggle when it's physical and he has his back to goal.

That said, Spain didn't play well overall. There was very little penetration or a high enough tempo to cause Chile problems, not enough runners from midfield, no real opportunities to play a killer pass. 

It's a shame though, when I saw that David had been given such a prominent role I really hoped he'd put in a performance and Spain would show some of their old zest.

But it wasn't to be, and that has a lot to do with Chile, who were phenomenal without the ball. They never relented, they have to get a lot of credit.

But it is sad to see Spain crumble in such a fashion, they've given football fans the world over countless hours of entertainment; this really has an end of an era feel to it.",0,1403185143,null,0,false,0,cibktgz,t3_28hlk3,t1_cibktgz,t3_28hlk3,null,1434308474,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

There are also near insurmountable technical issues with creating a self-sustaining tritium cycle too.  There's only about 25kg of the stuff in the world, and around 10% of it radioactively decays each year, and most of the reactors that make it will close fairly soon.  I really think fusion is a pipe dream.

Going from Sligachan, as stuntinisahobbit says, is more accessible from Portree, it's only 9 miles as opposed to 40+ to Blabheinn. I'd advise caution in the Cuillins - the paths aren't that clear and route finding can be tricky. Also, the weather can change in a heartbeat - we've had some crazy fog for the last couple of weeks. Bruach na Frithe is the easiest of the Black Cuillins, but still has an amazing view over the rest of the ridge and the island. Am Bastier can be reached from the same bealach, with Sgurr nan Gillean beyond. The route to the top of Gillean is really exposed, and if you're not too sure about it it can be a bit scary. There are a few Skye-based guiding companies like [Skye Adventure](http://www.skyeadventure.co.uk) who would see you right if you wanted to achieve more in the available time. You can walk to the Fairy Pools from Sligachan also, or do the Red Cuillin horseshoe, Marsco, or walk through the glen to Camusunary.

The Trotternish ridge is the other main walking area, it extends from the very North of the island to Portree and includes the old man of Storr and the Quirang. It would take more than a day to take in the whole route though. Storr mountain (above / behind the old man) is a great walk and gives a different perspective. You could, I suppose, walk back to Portree afterwards (there is a sign for a footpath at Storr Loch that says Portree 6 miles, but I've never walked it. At best, I'd guess it's a boggy cliff-top walk). There are a few buses and loads and loads of cars that go past in both directions - depends if you're feeling friendly!

Ben Tianavaig is a short-ish hill walk a few miles from Portree. It's a grassy pyramid, without any technical challenges, but affords a lovely view of the village.

true,poppajay,null,null,"Firstly, I think that the job you do is bloody fantastic and I have lots of time for anyone who works as a charity fundraiser, especially those who are street and/or door-to-door fundraising cause you're putting yourselves in the line-of-fire and have to deal with a lot, A LOT, of rejection and often abuse.

Fundraising for charity is not easy but is necessary. If left to their own devices, the good nature of people, who'd like to give to charities, is often buried by their more selfish/busy/apathetic selves. People most often need a little coaxing to do the decent thing and there's nothing to be ashamed about doing the coaxing.

It's amazing that charity fundraisers can be looked down upon but being a banker or a solicitor is admirable. This kind of public opinion is exactly why people need encouragement to be charitable and conscientious. 

Now, regarding this specific job/company, I don't think it's exactly right that private companies should be sub-contracted by charities to do fundraising but I guess it's cost effective, otherwise they wouldn't do it, and I guess it's impossible for a charity to have such a complete fundraising division that they are covering every possible funding source by their own internal means.  
That said, there are many companies that fundraise on behalf of charities and some are great and others not so. Sounds like yours is not so!
It is clearly wrong to coerce you to work longer hours than contracted.
I think, firstly, you should bring this up with the company and see what they have to say. Perhaps the management are unaware that the team leaders are doing this though I doubt that.
Either way, the charity they/you are working on behalf of would not at all be happy to have their name sullied with such practices. 
If you're not happy with the outcome of this then you should report the charity to the charities commission and the company to HMRC. 

This kind of job is normally just a stepping stone to something else anyway and is good experience and decent on a CV also. If you can't find a suitable resolution then move on and find something else.

When I got no kind of acknowledgement, I wrote again, just in case the first letter had got lost in the post. Some time went by: I was busy starting a new job in a new town.

The next thing that happened was that I was tracked down by the debt management company that they had sold my loan to after their 'repeated attempts' to contact me at my previous address. I had no choice but to deal with this debt company and all those convenient options for repayment - like being able to afford to pay - that came with the original loan were gone. I ended getting a loan to pay off the loan just to stop these cunts hassling me.

My point was that ""all other things being equal"" is not an agreed upon starting premise because pretty much everything I'd use to explain my point is tied up in ""all the other things"" you just threw out. 

Now you are right that there are Christian states that are not stable and Christians who have problems. This does result in terrorism but yes, not as much as we are currently with Islam, but to say ""this is proof that Islam is inherently bad"" just comes across as incredibly reductive when there is *so much* more than could be happening here.   

My point is the nature of the way people will currently fight for Islam could be the result of current state of the cultures and geopolitics involved. After all it's really not all that long ago that we'd, as a nation and individuals, would often fight *for*, or more often than not *about* Christianity. We've gone from crusades to Europe almost tore itself apart during the reformation and hell England *did* tear itself apart in a civil war that was largely sparked and very much fueled by different views on how to be Christian without being Catholic. Take a snapshot of any given point in that history and you'd more than likely have one in which it would be very easy to think Christianity was responsible for and could only ever result in violence...

It was one example but I'll note one example of how these kind of things can still happen and have religious ties in otherwise largely peaceful, stable and historically speaking very secular states.

What if there are time gaps between ur insurance policies?

Now when as an insurance person I see that the user had no insurance for 3 months and he is paying me on monthly basis I will factor in that thing in my premium... I will charge higher because having a gap in insurance policy may indicate to me that user can face cash crunch and can miss on payments... However if you have no gaps in insurance n u have all the insurance on record u may get a discount because It will suggest that u r good at paying and got ur insurance renewed on time...

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"&gt; So, to paraphrase: ""Democracy is not the responsibility of the people"". You know we're the ones who decide who even gets to be a politician, right? You think they're just going to magically sort out their attitude without anyone telling them to do it?

I wouldn't describe our system of representative democracy as 'democracy.' It's barely even governance. However, if we are to assume that we are a democracy and what we have is, indeed, governance, then democratic governance is supposed to be for *all* the people. Responsibility goes alongside power, and those with the most power have the most responsibility. That includes the responsibility to ensure that the system that they perpetuate is inclusive.

A voter has little to no power. Politicians have great power. Therefore, the responsibility lies with them.

&gt; Why would they? They don't need the youth vote so why go chasing after it?

If they are not choosing to serve and represent *all* the people to the absolute best of their abilities and power, then their power has no legitimacy. If the majority of people do not vote, then any government is fundamentally illegitimate.

&gt; From a different angle, if fewer people are interested in politics, there is a smaller pool from which politicians are drawn and consequently a narrowing of policies. 

There is little evidence that fewer people are interested in politics, just this *type* of politics. Just as many people support European Union in principle, but not *this specific* European Union, and so on.

&gt; You talk of a political party of science and reason, and, in fact, there is nothing stopping you from forming such a party yourself.
Why don't you? Why doesn't someone else? Because the sort of people you would be trying to appeal to do not vote. If they did, maybe more people would see politics worthwhile.

One day, I might. But, frankly, voter intentions do not change anything. Democracy, as we practise it, does not change anything significant. What changes the course of government, regardless of party, are external forces - commercial, military, technological and religious. Governments and parties adapt to the changes that those forces create, so the correct way to change parties and governments is to apply consistent pressure by means of money, innovation or some sort of violence (war, terrorism and so on).

Secondly, a truly scientific form of governance would simply not be legally permitted in the UK. There are hard and soft limits to the amount of change a political party is allowed to effect or call for. Hard limits are imposed legally and enshrine certain constitutional issues (elections, the monarchy, and so on), soft limits are imposed by the Royal Family. Our system provides no legal way to move to a significantly different system of governance without violent overthrow.",0,1403190052,null,0,false,0,cibmux3,t3_28ie9m,t1_cibmux3,t1_cibkpov,null,1434309435,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"Just as a critique of what he said, and to show you shouldn't take what politicians say at face value;  
  
&gt;a belief in freedom  
  
The Conservative view is a bit of a mixture between old One Nation conservatism and Neoliberalism inherited from Margaret Thatcher. ""Freedom"" in their sense of the word means political freedom of speech, but also freedom to work, freedom to run a business without much government regulation, and freedom to serve your country. It is a freedom which gives us basic, democratic liberties but does not provide us economic or social freedom that socialists tend to like; it is a freedom that is as much about responsibility as it is rights, a freedom within the nation to serve the ""national interest"". Other kinds of freedom are considered potentially dangerous, counter productive or just unnecessary.  
  
&gt;tolerance of others  
  
""Tolerance"" is a bit more defined than ""Freedom"". If you think really about what ""Tolerance"" is it's not actually that nice - it implies there is something negative to be ""Tolerated"", and if you're Conservative, that generally means tolerated but changed. So, ""Tolerance"" is often a word used to push an integrationist agenda over a multicultural one - rather than lots of different cultural communities, we should be one homogenous British community, and differences should be ironed out by the state, ""Tolerated"" for now.  
  
&gt;social responsibility  
  
Again for the Conservatives this is some of their One Nationism shining through; they admit that there is such thing as a society and that we all have responsibility towards it, but that society is a national one and our responsibility is more about serving its needs generally, not, for example, ensuring it is as inclusive as possible. So while socialists see social responsibility as about helping the poorest, the most vulnerable, minorities, for conservatives it's about helping society's components all work together to best serve a ""national interest"".  
  
&gt;respecting and upholding the rule of law  
  
This is a common one and one we like to pat ourselves on the back for. In reality it just means we have codified common law and we're proud of it. At one point (colonialism) we thought we were special for having comprehensive and detailed law that meant we aren't ruled arbitrary or despotically, but in reality there have been few historic societies that haven't had decent ""rule of law"". It may have seemed like despotism where rulers derive their powers from God, but generally there have been lots of checks and balances that weren't always apparent to British explorers and colonizers. Let's not forget too that British law is supposedly still derived from the Queen and by extension God, even if those laws aren't legitimized by religion any more.  
  
&gt;what sets Britain apart are the traditions and history that anchors them and allows them to continue to flourish and develop  
  
Again, a commitment to tradition is something very ""old Tory"" about Cameron's governance. An assertion that we have ""traditions and history"" and other countries don't is a bit ludicrous in my opinion, and not ""what sets Britain apart"" - few states claim *not* to be rooted in traditions and history because it helps legitimize them.  
  
Equally, when you look back at British history, 100 years ago women couldn't vote, politics was the preserve of white middle classes, we had an empire completely willing to subjugate foreign peoples largely based on misguided racial superiority, and even in the 1950s we were willing to unseat democratic governments based on colonial opinions that we know better than people in those countries (Mossadeq's Iran). For socialists, the best British values are not our ""traditions and history"" at all, but what's been changed in the last 100 years as Britiain becomes more diverse and, in theory, less classist.  
  
Cameron's words are filled with political partisanship, if you look for it, though it looks like a benign and bipartisan statement it's really not.",0,1403190648,null,0,1403190854,0,cibn465,t3_28jgfe,t1_cibn465,t1_cibj3v1,null,1435489598,13,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,13
true,[deleted],null,null,"Our current players
Keeper: 
**Hugo Lloris** - Top player, probably one of the five best goalies in the world. 

Defenders: 

Left Back - **Danny Rose**, not quite good enough according to many, mistake prone, may be replaced this summer. (Back up **Zeki Fryers**)

Center Backs - **Michael Dawson/Jan Vertonghen**, Daws is our captain (for now), but is aging and slow as molasses, he's still around because he reads the game well. Super Jan is entering his third season, his first was amazing, his second so-so (almost everybody was so-so). People generally love him, although some question his dedication. Back ups: **Younes ""jello knees"" Kaboul, Vlad ""The Defender"" Chiriches**. 

Right Back - **Kyle Walker** keeps getting better, very fast and elusive, his shot leaves something to be desired, but he keeps improving. Unfortunately missed the last third of last season due to injury and also missed playing in the World Cup for England. Backup **Kyle Naughton**, decent right back... shouldn't play on the left. 

Midfielders

Defensive Mids - **Sandro ""The Beast"" Raniere** very popular personality, pretty decent player, also has knees of possibly jello origin. **Paulinho**... Nobody knows what Paulinho is good for if you trust the message board the last week. 
Backups **Nabil Bentaleb**, young fella, our last manager loved him a little TOO much, but he's a great passer **Etienne Capoue**, looks legit, injured a lot as well his first season. **Moussa Dembele** is a sort of hybrid player, sometimes he's a starter and sometimes he's more attacking, great dribbler, smart player. 

Attacking Midfielders: **Christian Eriksen** Currently our star player, the only reason we didn't all kill ourselves or become hockey fans after Garteh Bale left for the biggest transer $$$ in history last season. **Erik Lamela** New last season (we bought seven starters last season with the Bale money) supposed to be a new star but was hurt for most of the season, if he's fit and as good as he's supposed to be next year things could be looking up! ** Now it gets murky depending on our line-up and new manager. Young or new/newish players **Nacer Chadli** **Lewis Holtby** **Andros Townsend** All exciting in their moments, also all have downsides. Aging players **Aaron Lennon** **Gylfi Siggurdson** (not really aging, but probably on the way out). 

Strikers: 

**Emmanuel Adebayor** Our best striker, also super expensive and prone to occasionally not trying for a whole season. We currently love him, but are wary of him and he's getting old. **Roberto Soldado** Bobby Solider came to Spurs last year as well, was great in his old league and kind of horrible for us. Not entirely his fault, he needs good passing from the midfield and we were in shambles at points last year. Really really hope he comes good this season. **Harry Kane** Young gun, full of promise, plegded not to shave until he went a game without scoring after scoring in two consecutive games, shaved the next week. 

Our system only plays one striker but we really probably need another, also we need a new left back. 

Oh, and our coach is new. 

And we're gonna win the league this year.

1) You are not to demand that your wife serves you. The submit command is from God to the wife, not to the man.

2) It does not say ""serve"", it says ""submit"", which simply means that in a christian based household, the man should have the final say in decisions.

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"I'm a postman, and even now I'm not working full time. I only work 5.5 hours a day. I have worked nearly all of my adult life, but only 2 years of full time in a 9-5. The rest of the time I ran my own business working whenever I felt like it or really needed to, worked a bit for/with my dad (which really wasn't much of a job and I spunked all my money on partying anyway) and just generally doing my best to avoid being an office drone. I did my A-Levels and did a few years of pretending to go to Uni.

I just saved a shitload when I was working full time, although I was still only on 26k but I lived with my parents and just paid them nominal house keeping. Then I quit and went travelling and when I came back my Mrs applied for a phd grant and won it, so we moved to Liverpool and my savings were enough for a deposit and her grant covered all our bills so any money I earn is savings, and we're pretty frugal - clothes from primark, no sky tv, only fly with ryanair/easyjet, shop at asda and plan all our meals a week in advance, no car, walk everywhere etc. Plus I'm constantly budgeting and with no friends in Liverpool it's really easy to save money because I rarely go out (although I can't wait till this changes). Should be a bit of equity in the house, plus a bit of savings and a re-mortgage and we should be have enough to buy a home when we move back to London, and can rent the Liverpool place out and earn a tiny bit out of it.  None of that is really anything out of the ordinary is it? I suppose the phd grant is the only thing that stands out.

But everyone I know in London jumped on the financial industry gravy train. I'd say 90% of my friends work in finance, anyone with even the slightest bit about them was able to get a reasonable job, as I did. And we all joined the work force in 07, just when all the shit hit the fan, so it was one of the hardest times to find/keep a job.

true,GimmeSomeSugar,null,null,"&gt;The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.  
Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.  
But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.  
This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.

Yes that one. The one where Bush Snr. had the option of pushing further into Iraq, but decided not to because he was wiser than his son.

&gt; But you're quite right, I completely forgot that genocide has an expiration date. 

The crime of genocide does not,. However under international law it is only justifiable to invade a country to prevent an imminent or ongoing genocide. It is not justified to start an invasion and kill thousands (and indirectly kill hundreds of thousands) of people merely to bring a single man (Saddam) to justice.

true,PopeGregoryIX,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"&gt;Responsibility goes alongside power, and those with the most power have the most responsibility. That includes the responsibility to ensure that the system that they perpetuate is inclusive.
A voter has little to no power. Politicians have great power. Therefore, the responsibility lies with them.

And what if they choose not to? Unless the voters get involved, nothing happens. Sitting around thinking that they ought to be better isn't going to make it so.

&gt;If they are not choosing to serve and represent all the people to the absolute best of their abilities and power, then their power has no legitimacy. If the majority of people do not vote, then any government is fundamentally illegitimate.

That's exactly the point. It is legitimate. We currently have a system in which it doesn't matter if most people don't even vote. All that matters is who the majority of the people who did vote voted for. Yes it's absurd, but we tried to change it and the majority of people couldn't even be bothered to vote for that.

&gt;There is little evidence that fewer people are interested in politics, just this type of politics. Just as many people support European Union in principle, but not this specific European Union, and so on.

My point was that this *type* of politics exists as a result of the lack of interest. It's a vicious circle that needs breaking. 

Not voting because you don't like the system is the same ridiculous logic as UKIP MEPs not turning up to the EU parliament because they don't think it has British interests. If it doesn't now, it certainly won't when we don't even bother to turn up.  

&gt;Our system provides no legal way to move to a significantly different system of governance without violent overthrow.

If the majority of people don't even give enough of a shit to try voting, they're certainly not going to bother with a revolution.

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"&gt; Whether they want to come here should be largely irrelevant. We should only let people come here if it is to our advantage.

Well I'd make the argument that almost all immigration is advantageous, especially with the economy being more global than it was previously.
Immigration, especially from former colonies (lesser cultural differences) strengthens our bind with those countries, encouraging travel and the exchange of money, ideas and technology. Those processes require services that our businesses can then exploit for monetary gain, effectively exchanging money back and forth between us and that other country. It gives us opportunities for outsourcing as well as entering large markets like China via a third party that understands the cultural differences better than us. 
The more money that flows the greater the opportunities for business to get involved which leads to prosperity, tax revenue and jobs.  

I think as long as we as a country remain _strict_ (and I mean really fucking strict) about workers rights and the minimum wage (and I might even be suggesting raising it here :)) we should be able to organically create the environment where its logical for *only* those that are skilled or are supported by enough money to make the journey over here. In an even contest, the native should win an employment battle against a non-skilled immigrant as long as the minimum wage is being observed (for higher paying jobs you'd expect people to have skills/experience/references that an unskilled immigrant would not be able to match).  
This prevents us from the fuck up of working out ""who is worthy and who isn't"". We want the Doctors and the Scientists from ""bongo bongo land"" but at the same time we don't want to accidentally prevent their brother from coming over, even though he's a useless sod his value is keeping his brother/sister in the country. While we might reject unskilled labourer X, he might somehow be the catalyst for a new start-up to be created in the UK. Assessing people at face value while understandable isn't going to effectively assess their true life value.  
Already the changes we've made to our immigration policy has prevented incredibly intelligent individuals that I personally know to study here from Malaysia and that's a damaging worry because people like this may well contribute a great deal to our economy.  

I think the point I'm trying to make (that you more or less made too) is that we should be fighting the employers here over minimum wage and working practices as opposed to getting too distracted by the subject of immigration. I belive we can create the right sort of meritocracy to create an environment that promotes the behaviours we want and keep the undesirable behaviours to a minimum. Although I am willing to admit that I might be a touch idealistic ;).",0,1403192691,null,0,false,0,cibo1fi,t3_28jb3g,t1_cibo1fi,t1_cibnbiu,null,1434309991,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

true,LordAnubis12,eng-sussex,Brighton,"&gt; There were over 1000 applicants for 5 positions (and it's not a great job). When I see a young person struggling to get work I don't think that they're lazy, or need to grind some more in unpaid internships. I see people whom society has badly let down, and I have a ton of empathy for them

What's your take on Milibands announcement today?

&gt; Society - and pensions especially - are still built around the idea that when you're old you'll own your own place and not have rent to pay

I heard on radio 4 a caller who had a pension and his own home complaining that interest rates were penalising him as his pension wasn't growing. When confronted that there are many people who would effectively have neither through no fault of their own (be it accident) he just didn't understand and the response was 'move somewhere cheaper' - even though the caller who had no job, house or pension because of an accident lived somewhere very cheap. 

I think that's the biggest issue - people over 40/50ish I guess just assume that pensions and houses are both a given - yet for young people  (like myself) it's the biggest (for me at least, which says something) cause of anxiety/fear - sure the next 10 years may be fine, but I still won't be able to afford a house or have contributed to a pension by the time I'm in my 30s.


I do agree with you too on the immigration point - but sadly it's those that are least in contact with immigrants that think they are ruining the country and vote UKIP etc. It's why I find it hard to view them validly and links into my other point on elections/power and how it's not based on evidence but just people going 'more people = more GP queues! Stop immigrants!' even though that's clearly bollocks.

true,forgottenoldusername,eng-manchester,It is indeed grim up north.,"Keeping in mind I've not bothered to look at the figures you've got there, but I will when I get home later on;


There is a connection between mortality and heat waves. 
Prolonged higher than average temperature generally means higher levels of air pollution.

Even small air pollutant increases can have large effects on mortality, which could well could explain a higher than normal death rate.

Plenty of research freely available on air pollution, temperature and mortality. It's something we're only recently realising, we've recognised the importance of air quality for a long time. But research in the past few years has found some pretty worrying evidence on how a small change in air quality can have a fairly sizeable effect on health and mortality. There is a interesting paper that came out of South Korea linking certain air pollutants to health complications such as stroke which I'm sure was fairly easy to find, if you care.

Similar effects were seen in the great London smog event in 1952, which you might be interesting in researching. 

Perhaps that was just enough to push death rates above birth rates for a short time?

But without looking at more data and information, it's hard to draw any sort of conclusion. Could it be perhaps that there is a longer term trend in population/birth and death rates? Could it be something completely different. 

Remember correlation does not necessarily equal causation, boring but so often ignored.

It's barbaric, but it's also a *highly* efficient system to coerce people into using health insurance companies.  If individuals and insurers paid the same price then people could reasonably opt not to use them, and cover their expenses themselves, but as insurers get a better deal than private individuals hospitals then they de-facto become the most economical option, which forces people to use them.

In fact it also acts to force people into work (as US employers typically offer health insurance as a benefit for most for non-trivial jobs), and keeps them nicely terrified of ever being fired, establishing a lovely little power-imbalance that means employers can treat their employees much worse than most other countries, because if they lose their job they lose so much more than just the job.",0,1403196891,null,0,false,0,cibq2gx,t3_28jom3,t1_cibq2gx,t1_cibllmo,null,1434311014,38,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,38

true,HarryBlessKnapp,eng-GreaterLondon,South Weezey Mandem,"I've not really achieved much. My ambition in life was to get a house and an easy job, I'm not the most ambitious but I suppose having modest goals makes achieving that little bit more immediate. 

Yeah I'd say I come from a fairly ambitious background . So I'd agree with you about values. I do realise we're all pretty lucky. Most of my friends haven't had to really work incredibly hard to get to where they are. The ones that have worked really hard are doing very very well for themselves. I do come from an affluent background but no one is rich. It's quite a happy medium tbh. It's just the luck of where we were born. So bringing it back to your original question; from my experience it's a great country to have the fortune of being born in. It doesn't feel like the country is going to shit. The media and the Internet maginifies everything. I'm very proud to be British but the direction we're heading in has very little baring on that. Although I think we're doing okay. It's good to be critical though, it means you're striving to improve. My advice would simply be to use your brain. 5-10 years ago I couldn't imagine I'd be able to do so much and relatively easily. But as you get older things seem to fall in to place, you adjust your goals and your behaviour and as you get wiser and better with money etc, unless you get really unlucky, you slowly edge towards your goals without even realising. Just keep plugging away, plan ahead, work hard enough, but not so hard that you don't enjoy yourself. And if you're a bit of a loose cannon like I was, maybe get yourself a good boyfriend/girlfriend because they're a really good way to help you reign yourself in a bit.

Edit: oh and make sure you are always budgeting and doing your best to save money. Just knowing how much you've got available for each particular expense is a massive step in the right direction. But I didn't bother doing that till I was about 23/24. I spent all my money on drugs and booze till then.

When John Major left Downing Street in 1997, he left behind some of the best economic statistic this country has ever seen.

Nobody we knew had any issues affording a house.  Buying one was taken for granted (as today) but despite higher mortgage rates prices were lower and pretty much everyone in a half decent job could have a half decent house.  The family home I grew up in (Edinburgh) was worth £80k when we bought it in 1984, my parents sold it in 2007 for £650k and it sold again in 2013 for over £700k having had nothing done to it.  **No fucking way** could my parents have bought that house today.

However, but as you rightly say, the housing market in this country is now at crisis point.  I have £23k in savings, am saving about £6000 a year (but looking to increase) and even for me it'll be at least 2-3 years before I can afford to get a deposit on a decent house outside of London (sick of flats, not buying one) let alone other fees and furnishing the place.

The right thing to do would be a controlled price deflation (or massive crash, whatever) to stimulate the economy and take the heat out of the market, but good luck with BTL parasites and MPs agreeing to this as their own investments would be fucked up.

What I did in the UK, and don't quote me on that one, I took a large sum of cash with me (not the safest choice) and used travellers checks - before they raised the IOF from 6% to 15% on those as well. In Panama, I used a lot of Western Union and they are really easy. Their rate is quite low, 0.38%. But the thing is, if you are sending the money from Brazil, they would have a limit of BRL 4000.

Worst thing is it's not the education or knowledge from the degree they value, as a result, if you do a masters or PhD, you could very well end up in an even worse employment situation.

Every cloud has a silver lining; up until 2008, having a degree in absolutely anything from Oxford or Cambridge would land you most jobs pretty well by default.

I think there's a portion of that. 

However 2xaverage wage earners at 26k (35k in London) equals a fairly standard -200/280k mortgage at 4x lending (which isn't extreme). Add in a deposit of 10-20% (which you kind of need if planning on buying in SE and you are suddenly lookin at houses worth 350/400k.

I bought in last 5 years and nobody would have given us 6x income. Let alone consider us without our deposit. 

I think the simple fact is in a modern life we have to expect two earners for a mortgage.  That makes the whole thing seem less unreasonable. 

Even even assuming 6x mortgage at 100% lending on avg UK salary of 26k, that's 150k mortgage. Which means a 2% rate rise would be adding 60 quid a month to a standard mortgage give or take.  Tis not huge. That's what people spend on a Friday in the pub. My bloody dry cleaning bill is £60 for work suits once every 2 months.

If you don't have a permanent address you should not be splashing out on luxuries. It really is as simple as that.

If you're going out every week getting drunk and paying £50 a month on your phone contract rather than saving up for a deposit (bear in mind that if you're in temp accommodation the local authority will pretty much cover it all.... you'd have less bills than a regular person would have) then you are an idiot and don't deserve sympathy.

true,King_of_Avalon,eu,Croatian,"This is all true, and to pick up on a few other things:

&gt; It's barbaric, but it's also a highly efficient system to coerce people into using health insurance companies.

Actually, it's more than that now. Starting next April, people will be assessed a fine along with their tax rebate if they *don't* have health insurance of some kind. This was part of the whole Obamacare thing. This is easier said than done, as there are two government-mandated insurance marketplaces now that ostensibly offer competitive rates: the federal insurance marketplace, and the state one. All states are obliged to create a state insurance marketplace, but many of the conservative Republican-controlled states have opted out of the federal marketplace, limiting choice dramatically. Mine is one of those (my flight back to the UK leaves on 16 July, thank fuck).

In effect, the whole Obamacare thing is just a massive corporate bailout to private insurance companies. Any true progressive should loathe it, and any pro-market conservative should be kicking themselves that they didn't come up with it first (and they did - it's modelled after Mitt Romney's state insurance plan in Massachusetts). Why those two groups have reversed positions I'll never quite understand. Also:

&gt; In fact it also acts to force people into work (as US employers typically offer health insurance as a benefit for most for non-trivial jobs), and keeps them nicely terrified of ever being fired, establishing a lovely little power-imbalance that means employers can treat their employees much worse than most other countries, because if they lose their job they lose so much more than just the job.

Definitely. I know plenty of people who are stuck in their jobs that they hate because of the benefits they get. However, I'd also add that the number of new jobs being created that offer benefits is shrinking, and most of those 'trivial' jobs with no benefits have been the bulk of the post-recession recovery (were it not for the NHS, I reckon England would be seeing the same type of thing, what with the rise of zero-hour contracts, JSA forcing young people into Tesco's to work for free, unpaid internships, etc.)

I had a blood test done a few weeks ago that cost me $79. I had the same test twice in the UK for free, obviously. I don't have health insurance because my state opted out of the federal exchange and the cheapest quote I can get is around $150/month, which is about 20% of my gross wages.

I used to work in this field, and as someone from a third world country who has spent months volunteering to help out in Africa I can tell you what this meme says and what he actually did are two hugely different things.

I worked with organizations like Unicef, USAID, AFAID, TheAfricaProject and other huge NGO's and being an ambassador and ""devoting your time to help starving children"" couldn't be more different. Getting the title ambassador is basically a way for the organization to get a celebrity on board to gain more publicity. Its always a win-win-win situation because the organization gets money to fund their projects, the celebrity feels ""good"" and the people who need help can continue to get it. And generally the ambassador writes a nice check to the organization, makes a small video interview, spends 1 day at one of the base camps or facilities and gets a nice photo op with some children. After that they are on their merry way. They are not like the thousands of unpaid volunteers that are actually doing all the work and spending days, weeks or months at a time to helping the cause, which is what this meme is insinuating.

So is what he is doing a good thing, yes. But is he devoting all his time to help starving children? No not at all. And meme's like this are only exaggerating and falsifying an already good deed.

This is something of a Europe wide issue - we've already seen riots etc kick off in France, the Turkish aren't particularly well integrated in Germany which appears to be causing some tension, and we have the rise of the Front national and UKIP which have their blatant racism hidden under a mask of populism. People clearly feel suspicious/threatened, which does show up a failure in how immigration is handled currently. It's like we allow immigration, but are perfectly happy to just let the new arrivals segregate rather than have policies/systems in place to make sure there is sufficient integration.

#

&gt; Buddhist violence in Myanmar are the ethnic terror attacks, particularly against the Rohingya people and other Muslims in the region. The terror attacks were motivated by Buddhist monks (the prominent among whom is Wirathu) with the creation of the 969 Movement. The violence reached prominence in June 2012 when more than 200 people were killed and around 100,000 were displaced.

#

&gt; A Buddhist fundamentalist group, Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), had expressed concerns about the growth of the Muslim economy in Sri Lanka and urged the fellow Buddhist to boycott such products manufactured and sold at Muslim retail chains. In response to the appeal in March 2013, a bhikkhu led a mob of hundreds of Buddhists to attack a retail chain lead by Muslim owner in Colombo.

#

&gt; In more modern times Buddhist-inspired terrorism or militarism have occurred in Japan, such as the Ketsumeidan assassinations led by Nichiren Buddhist preacher Nissho Inoue. The Zen priest Brian Daizen Victoria documented in his book Zen at War how Buddhist institutions justified Japanese militarism in official publications and cooperated with the Japanese Army in the Russo-Japanese War and World War II. In response to the book, several sects issued an apology for their wartime support of the government.

&gt; Aum Shinrikyo, the shinshūkyō that unleashed Sarin gas into the Tokyo subway and killed thirteen people, injuring fifty, drew upon Buddhist ideas and scriptures.

#

&gt; One of the celebrated rituals in Tibetan Buddhism is the Tibetan monastic assassination in 841 of King Langdarma.

As I see it, the problem is that the anti-UKIP strategy so far has been to try to label it as the racist party.  That strategy has not worked.  

And I think this is a failure by those on the left to engage in meaningful debate.  It may well be true that UKIP *are* racist, but nowadays the left call just about *everything* they don't like bigoted, racist and probably fascist too, so perhaps you can understand why many people just aren't interested any more.

It turns out that much of the UK really are concerned about Europe and immigration.  Maybe they're *all* racist!  Maybe everyone's a racist except for Lenny Henry (and I'm not even too sure about him).  Or maybe, it's time for Labour and the Conservatives to take the electorate's concerns more seriously.

A hospital trust was put in the hands of a private venture, and three years later the hospital had gone from one of the worst in the country to one of the best.

Mainly by reversing almost all of Labours policies...... especially the one regarding managers and administrators who had never been medical professionals (they all got sacked, except for a relatively small team that was kept to do+file the paperwork).

Note: The hospital facilities, staff, equipment etc was all still owned by the NHS (and by extension, the government) but the day to day running of the hospital taken care of by the Hospital Trust was put in the hands of private ventures under contract, much like how the NHS commissions its equipment, buys its drugs under contract from suppliers (like most healthcare systems the world over) and outsources its misc facilities (TV, etc) and cleaning under contract.",0,1403205502,null,0,false,0,cibudrq,t3_28jom3,t1_cibudrq,t1_cibltdh,null,1434313047,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But, the NHS still costs money, and those costs are still paid by you. The difference is that in the USA the original poster paid those costs because **they** were having a child. In the UK **tax payers** would have settled the cost. 

Now that's a double edged sword... because on the one hand it means people with no money to pay for insurance cover can have children and we all cover it. BUT, the flip side is that it often (birth being one of the only exceptions) it means young working age adults pay massive taxes to cover the costs of treating people, who for the most part are over 65... often much older than that.

I would also point out, that bill is probably not the bill of a normal delivery.

The forces applied may be various forms of forced migration (deportation, population transfer), as well as mass murder, and intimidation.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"A CT-head scan in the UK costs around the same amount. The difference is you don't see the bill afterwards - the Treasury does. It might not seem like an expensive thing but it really is - they cost around £500,000 to 1,000,000 to install, not including the cost of any associated building work needed to accomodate them. Also, these aren't like a computer you just buy and leave in the corner... they are complex devices that need expensive warranty and maintenance contracts with 24 hour on site support, and provision for replacements in the event of a serious failure. They also need regular calibration, teams of 3-4 people to operate them, bring patients round and keep things running. Then ontop of that you need a specialist doctor in radiology to actually look at the pictures they produce which can take up to 10-30 minutes per patient. The costs all add up, and £2000-3000 per scan is probably not far off.

As a general rule, every night in an NHS hospital bed is around £300 excluding any scans/investigations/operations etc. An intensive care bed is more like £1500 (bearing in mind you've got ratios of around 3 clinical staff for every patient).

I don't mean to refute your message which is that the US is expensive - it is.

Just because there are 5 Liverpool players in the England team DOES NOT, DOES FUCKING NOT mean they will be as good as when they play for Liverpool. Woy and his awful defensive tactics mean the like of Henderson and Gerrard are wedged between helping out Rooney who is completely disinterested and covering Jagielka and Cahill. 

Never been a fan of Woy, what did he actually win or for that matter achieve at a big club. Sure he is a likeable fellow, wouldn't mind him as a friend, but that isn't going to win things. Summed up by the line ""We had Pirlo in mind"" when asked about changing Rooney and Raheem around. Rooney is by far the better defensive player, that's one of his fucking strengths. He has put Rooney there because of the media pressure. Pick your own fucking team Woy, get Rooney off, get Barkley or Lallana on. 

/rant over. 

EDIT: Not since McClaren have I felt so deflated as an England fan. One thing I really admired watching Chile last night was their passion. They have maybe 2-3 good players, the rest are pretty average, but they had SO MUCH PASSION. The national anthem was sung, not lip synced. The fought for each other, played for each other. England, devoid of it and that goes for every player. 

Tactics, the fuck were they? Suarez nearly catches us out with a whipped corner. Solution, put someone on the fucking post Woy. Baines goes to post, then proceeds to trundle along the fucking goaline to the far post nearly letting in an exact replica of what happened before. Pace was totally lacking. The one time we did have some, we scored. For the next 5 mins, we played at pace and put them under pressure. Then we sat back and let them win. Just fuck off Woy. I want to see someone in who knows what the big occasion is. Van Gaal, Hiddink, Del Bosque have all been there and done it. Who do we have, an ex-Fulham manager, breaking records here.

On a side note, congratulations to Suarez and Uruguay, pains me to say it but I'm glad they won. No passion, no points for England.

true,LFCMick,null,Meath,"&gt; Ultimately it's FIFAs fault for allowing the citizenship loophole in the first place

It's not FIFA who determined this, people from the island of Ireland have had a birthright to Irish citizenship since 1937. Those players have been able to play for the ROI because under the eyes of the law they're as Irish as someone from Dublin, Cork or Galway.

&gt; FAI intent on using sectarian divisions in NI to scoop up young Catholic talent.

As a ROI fan; The FAI are a lot of things, mostly incompetent, but to call them sectarian is baseless, the reason most of the players who have switched are nationalist is exactly that, they see themselves as Irish and wish to play for the team that better represents them.

They FAI aren't actively going after Catholic players; in fact the opposite is true. [Brian Kerr when he was manager actively discouraged players from NI from switching](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-14473563). From that same article:

&gt; ""I inherited one or two and one or two came after that but we didn't make it easy for them.
&gt; ""We did, in fact, tell some players that they would be better off not playing for us because they were unlikely to get to the top level.""

Players such as Alan Kernaghan and Adam Barton both come from Ulster Protestant backgrounds and both have had no problem representing the Republic. The FAI aren't pursuing some sectarian agenda.

&gt; The IFA for their part could certainly do more by choosing an exclusively Northern Irish sporting anthem, but there are plenty of Irish symbols in our teams already for the most part,

This I agree with, The NI crest with it's shamrocks and Celtic cross is an excellent symbol for the team, I prefer the NI crest to the ROI one in fact. The IFA could easily do more to choose a uniquely NI sporting anthem but they haven't.

&gt; At the end of the day the buck stops with FIFA.

FIFA stepped in to mediate this in 2007. FIFA offered a compromise whereby players born on both sides of the border would be eligible for both the FAI and IFA: 

&gt; “[E]very player born on the territory of Northern Ireland, holding the UK nationality and being entitled to a passport of the Republic of Ireland or born on the territory of the Republic of Ireland and holding the Irish nationality could either play for the [FAI] or the [IFA], under the condition that all other relevant prerequisites pertaining to player’s eligibility for a specific Association team are fulfilled”.

You can read that in [this](http://greenscene.me/2011/06/fifa-player-eligibility-in-the-context-of-ireland-the-actual-rules-the-real-facts-and-dispelling-the-prevailing-myths/) article, which gives an insight into the whole eligibility issue. 

The FAI accepted this compromise while the IFA rejected it.

The only two long term solutions to this problem are an All-Ireland team or the above proposal. Since the IFA rejected both proposals they have absolutely no right to complain when a player switches to the ROI.

I feel genuinely sorry for NI fans as their own governing body are responsible for this situation for getting as bad as it has.",0,1403207940,null,0,false,0,cibvmoz,t3_28gha6,t1_cibvmoz,t1_cibrjr6,null,1434313634,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

The US system has a lot of faults. I mean, like a fuck-ton of faults. But people here tend to get blinded by that and miss its merits. For example, the US system - even accounting for the fact it fails to cover 20% of the population and has poor medical records by UK comparison, **still** produces better cancer detection and treatment rates than the NHS. Now, this is something the NHS *ought* to be very good at... because the NHS has joined up primary and secondary healthcare records covering people from birth to death, excellent statistics and brilliant screening programs... it should pick up cancers left right and center, yet in practice the NHS doesn't. That's important, because all the evidence from around the world says that early detection is one of *the* biggest single determinants in cancer survival.

The bottom line is, you are right - the NHS is ""efficient"". But within that efficiency are a lot of deficiencies, and many of those boil down to money. The trouble is you can't make a direct comparison and say the UK pays half as much.. because it doesn't *""pay half as much""* for the same thing.

People die here every year because hospital beds are over-occupied which causes infections like MRSA and C.diff to be far more prevalent here than elsewhere in the world. It also encourages antibiotic resistance. Under-provision of MRI scanners is also a massive problem. The NHS needs more money to replace its stock of aging hospitals, and there need to be rules in place to make sure that when one patient leaves a bed it is at least 6 hours before another moves into it. If a patient dies in a bed, then there needs to be at least 12 hours before someone else moves into that space.

If you want a vicious attack together with small, fast teams I would say a counter-attacking style is good but the problem is they are often on the defensive. I am trying to think of a team which is known for speed and Liverpool spring to mind after some deliberation.

Find me a definition of ethnic cleansing from a respected encyclopaedia or dictionary which doesn't describe it in a way applicable to our actions in Diego Garcia. It's in [wikipedia's list of ethnic cleansings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_cleansings#1960s). Some examples from more formal sources:

&gt;&gt;  &gt; The mass expulsion or killing of members of one ethnic or religious group in an area by those of another.

[Oxford Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ethnic-cleansing?q=ethnic+cleansing)

&gt; &gt; &gt; ethnic cleansing, the attempt to create ethnically homogeneous geographic areas through the deportation or forcible displacement of persons belonging to particular ethnic groups.

[Encyclopaedia Britannica](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/194242/ethnic-cleansing) 

As I said, people tend to mix it up with genocide which is itself a form of ethnic cleansing but not the entirety of it.

true,SuffragettePizza,null,null,"First things first **do not buy anything, do anything, make any arrangements for moving until you have exchanged** Nothing is final until exchange has happened. Buying a property in the UK can be a nightmare, and nothing is secure until you have exchanged contracts. Something like 40% of accepted offers never make it to exchange. 

Also, **get a homebuyer's survey done** it is about £300 or so but it is so worth it. We got one done on our flat, even though plenty of people told us not to bother with it - it revealed some huge electrical issues that made the property unsafe and would have cost us over £1000 to fix. Because we caught that all before we moved in, we were able to plan for it and we got some money from the seller to complete the work. It saved us about £850 in all. If you are buying a house and not a flat, it is even more of an absolute **must**

- Put a couple of grand aside for house emergencies and keep adding to it each month (doesn't have to be much, we put about £50 aside). Emergencies always happen - whether it's your dishwasher breaking, an unexpected bill, having to hire a plumber or electrician suddenly, having money put to one side is a necessity when you own a home. You do not want to be caught without money in an emergency. 

- Do any large work before you move in, if possible. Living without a kitchen is balls, living without a bathroom is balls, living in house-demolition mess is balls. I can speak to this as someone who has lived in all three of those situations during the last year (It is indeed balls) and is currently still living with no kitchen and in a pigsty. 

- For the love of god, check the boiler and radiators are up to scratch. You do not want to get to October and realise that your heating doesn't work and it's gonna cost you a grand to fix it. As someone who spent the past winter without any central heating, I can confirm that it sucks massively. 

- If you're having any work done by a tradesman, get a written quote before they start. Getting ripped off and not having a leg to stand on is really bad. Always get three quotes, don't always go for the cheapest. Get recommendations or go with someone who is highly rated if you can't. I always use ratedpeople.com because you can see previous reviews and only people who have actually used the tradesmen are able to leave a review.

- Don't be in a rush to decorate the entire house immediately. Try and do things like painting, getting new floors, buying new furniture gradually, because it takes a while to get used to a space, so your initial design ideas might not necessarily fit/suit the space and because it'll take a while for you to figure out how you use each room and how it functions best. This way you won't waste money on paint/flooring/furniture that you have to get rid of in 6 months because you rushed into it. 

With regards to cooking, my advice is as follows:

- Try to cook from scratch whenever possible. It saves huge amounts of money. 

- Build up a bunch of recipes that you can do quickly, cheaply and easily. These will be useful for middle of the week meals and end of the month meals. 

- Buy in bulk if you use something regularly and it is non-perishable or long lasting. We buy our pasta in bags of 5kg because we know we use pasta at least once a week. It saves us about £15/£20 every other month. Ditto with flour. ",0,1403209504,null,0,1403209772,0,cibwge2,t3_28jpr1,t1_cibwge2,t3_28jpr1,null,1434314095,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6

true,AidenTai,null,null,"American here. Here's the thing: no one pays $40,000. First there are those that are uninsured and have no intent to pay, but go to the hospital anyways. While they are a minority of the US population (~10%) they overuse the emergency room so much (by going for minor complaints, checkups, etc.) because they can't be turned away at the ER that they rack up immense bills that they simply don't pay. Meaning everyone else has to foot the bill for it. It's particularly bad because ER visits tend to be extremely expensive compared to normal ones. That's reason #1 prices are so high up front—you're paying for your bills plus the cost of treating the freebies.  

The second reason is a strange combination of medical monopolies, lack of competition, and powerful private insurance. Normally competition drives down prices and leads to a good deal for consumers. But in emergencies, you simply end up going to the closest location and are obliged to pay whatever they charge (essentially these are in situ monopolies). Without competition, hospitals feel free to charge exorbitant amounts.  

With regular checkups, the situation is different. Because there are relatively few, powerful insurance companies, they have a lot of leeway at setting and negotiating hospital prices. If a doctor tried to charge more, then the insurance companies could simply refuse to allow their members to see that doctor, and the doctor would see a tremendous reduction in the number of patients that saw him. Thus any insured individual will probably end up paying a reasonable amount for a non‐emergency situation, merely because his insurance company will drive a hard bargain and reduce prices for him. Uninsured individuals will have no such negotiating power. These people generally avoid seeing doctors unless absolutely necessary because of the cost. This means that hospitals know that when insured individuals visit, they are willing to pay a lot simply because they need the care. Without a powerful insurance company to negotiate for them, they end up paying the full price (or just refuse to pay).  

Taken together, the large majority of people have insurance and have insurance that is good enough to greatly reduce hospital bills from the list price to some special low price. For a bill like this $40,000 charge, an insurance company would probably negotiate it down to about $7,000 or so and pay most of it. An individual with decent insurance would probably only be personally responsible for $50–1,000 or so of the list price. And someone without insurance would probably be poor and thus unable to pay the $40,000. So in the end, no one pays $40,000.",1,1403209793,null,0,1403215322,0,cibwlox,t3_28jom3,t1_cibwlox,t1_cibvyme,null,1434314163,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I've seen, and talked to a fair number of people for whom the status quo there is absolutely *not* fine. Additionally, whenever /r/ukpolitics appears in meta subreddits, it's now at the point where it's fairly frequently spoken of in the same sense as /r/Europe was a year ago or so- ""they're basically a bunch of far-right whackjobs"". 

In /r/Europe's case, moderators finally got their act together and went absolutely to town on the influx of bigots- now it's a reasonably pleasant place again. 

Since that's not really happening to anything like the same extent in /r/ukpolitics, and given that a number of this subreddit's present subscribers have spent the past few months trying to drag /r/ukpolitics back to something less insane from within, with little success?

 &gt;Of the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, he said this person was a ‘classic third-rate suck-up-kick-down sycophant presiding over a shambolic court’: ‘MPs have no real knowledge of how to function other than via gimmick and briefings. That's also how No 10 works. It's how all of them are incentivised to operate. You get ahead by avoiding cock-ups and coming up with tactical wins, you don't get ahead by solving very hard problems.’

 &gt;Then he spoke of '…politicians running around who don't really know what they're doing all day or what the purpose of their being in power is.'

 &gt;'Everyone thinks there's some moment, like in a James Bond movie, where you open the door and that's where the really good people are, but there is no door.'

 &gt;'As Bismarck said about Napoleon III, Cameron is a sphinx without a riddle — he bumbles from one shambles to another without the slightest sense of purpose.'  

 &gt;'Everyone is trying to find the secret of David Cameron, but he is what he appears to be. He had a picture of Macmillan on his wall — that's all you need to know.'

The comments were touched upon during ministers' questions but Gove gave evasive answers.

After their *well if it happens three times, we'll take it more seriously* speech, if they were a private police I'd have told them right then, that they weren't being renewed, that they were fired.

Many companies employ private security to top up the chronic failings of our police to address matters they consider important.  The argument is that if you didn't *have* to pay for the police, you'd have more choice.  Obviously that negates the fact that many beneficiaries of the police don't pay significant taxes anyway.

3. Cahill - Looked fantastic. Could not defend Luis Suarez on his own though, but some crucial clearances and blocks were made by him today. 


**Worst**

1. Welbeck - Did nothing amazing and failed to influence the game. 

2. Rooney - Yes he scored, but he scored a tap in after the work was already done.

Gets dispossessed way to easy, and is not the most creative of players.

In terms of GDP we pay almost exactly half as much in the UK as the US.

&gt;the flip side is that it often (birth being one of the only exceptions) it means young working age adults pay massive taxes to cover the costs of treating people, who for the most part are over 65... often much older than that.

I wouldn't call that the flip side. To me it's one of the great things about the NHS.

&gt;I would also point out, that bill is probably not the bill of a normal delivery.

It might be. To avoid litigation, a lot of unnecessary procedures are carried out in the US.

You make it sound as if you resent people for wanting access to health care. That's just messed up to me (and probably most Brits/Europeans)

As for 'only $1,000', that means you pay your insurance all year, and still have to pay a thousand bucks? Wow. 

I have never have to pay more than a certain % of my income to pay for healthcare. If I don't earn enough (£10,000/$15,000) I pay nothing, and still get healthcare. But either way, when I show up at a hospital, I get seen, I get treated, and I go home not a single penny (1.5 cents) worse off.

true,LordMondando,null,null,"Brief run down. Completely abolish primary care trusts. Link each person to a national health insurance profilo. Every time you need to use the NHS all costs etc are directly given to the health care center (hospital, GP clinic whatever) directly from the department of health by charging this portfolio. It's important to note that in normal use, this profilio is not an account with some finite sum of money in it, simply a pathway for accounting.

The real advantage is that healthcare need, then tracks healthcare costs directly. 

For example, I get in a minor car crash, in real terms I need an MRI and or a CET, several days hospitalisation, medication etc. A process that costs thousands. As it stands that just comes out of the primary healthcare provides funds. With this system they would charge said profit for all costs. 

So though completely unlikely to every happen, the health care provider (clinic.. etc) that had no patients in that day, would only incur running costs of the premises and labor costs. Busy primary healthcare providers get money as they need it, less busy ones don't. 

Moreover, if people say wanted access to a drug, not currently deployed by PCS's, they could pay into their own profilio, any surplus amount put in could then be used at that persons discretion. 

Unless insurance systems (which say in France/Germany, do have the advantage of tracking need) you don't pay upfront then have it reimbursed. 

Moreover, this actually wouldn't be that hard to computerize and automate, I say that as an M.Sc computing student. Not trivial sure, but the 'tracking need/use' aspects allows for potentially huge sums to be saved on administration. Though previously this largely would have been even more administration, its likely now far less. 

Finally, it would in cases of frivolous use of the NHS (people coming in drunk smashed up time and time again, people missing the N'th appointment, that person could then be charged by putting their profilio into deficit which they are then legally required to pay back.

The only downside I suppose, is a lot of NHS non-medical staff would be put out of work.

What is the point in travelling thousands of miles to and then around Brazil, putting in many hours in on the training ground, doing all the media crap you have to do for the team, if you're aren't even going to try to mark Luis Suarez? It's one thing to say ""well we tried to mark Luis Suarez but it didn't really work because he's a world class player"", but they weren't even trying to mark him for that goal. People will criticise Gerrard, and no doubt he made a mistake, but there's a difference. Gerrard's job was to go challenge Cavani for the header, he did that but didn't get it quite right. That happens. But Cahill and/or Jagielka's job was to mark Luis Suarez. And they're not even trying.

If Italy beats Costa Rica, their GD will drop by at least 1. That puts them at +1. It's possible for this to be lower if Italy wins by more than 1.

Then, Italy MUST win against Uruguay to knock points out of the equation. This will also drop their GD by at least 1, leading to a -2 GD. 

England now must beat Costa Rica by 2, which will drop Costa Rica's to -1, and England's to 0*. ~~I'm not sure what would happen if they only won by 1 and brought the GD to 0 each...~~ Actually, if England only win by 1 their GD goes up to -1, but Costa Rica's remains at 0.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;So though completely unlikely to every happen, the health care provider (clinic.. etc) that had no patients in that day, would only incur running costs of the premises and labor costs. Busy primary healthcare providers get money as they need it, less busy ones don't.

Cost is only somewhat related to use. A hospital will need an MRI scanner whether ten people or ten thousand people use it an a given year. An A&amp;E department costs the same whether it's busy or quiet. 

You're covering this to an extent with ""would only incur running costs of the premises and labor costs"", but in many cases I'd expect running and labour costs to be in the majority.

&gt;Moreover, this actually wouldn't be that hard to computerize and automate, 

Now we're getting into the discussion of why UK government can't deliver IT projects. That would need to be fixed first.

&gt;The only downside I suppose, is a lot of NHS non-medical staff would be put out of work.

Johnson(unfortunately) was mostly shit, although better than against Italy.
Despite what some here said, Cahill played great - it's hard being the only defender on your team that's competent, and he appeared to realize that in how he was always on the ball even if it was another defender's territory.

Henderson played great and with a lot of heart, albeit not in a position that maximized his potential.
Gerrard played alright, but he's showing his age. 
Sterling played well and energetic as usual but held the ball a bit long and ran himself into trouble - he's young so that's expected. Excited to see him in 4 years (he'll only be 23?!!)
Welbeck may as well have been sitting off the pitch, he was a ghost. 
Rooney played better, but not amazingly compared to what I've seen.

Which would contradict with significant amounts of scripture stating that men and women are created equal. When interpreting verses (especially contentious ones) if the interpretation doesn't fit with the rest of the Bible or indeed Paul's writing then it's most likely the wrong one. This verse is probably one of the most contraversial in the New Testament and many scholars have argued for centuries over it's meaning. What it definitely does not say though is that women are doormats or that men are more important than women.

Furthermore, I don't know whether you missed it deliberately but this is proven in the verse previous:

.. But the NHS is very bad for example at detecting cancers in young adults. Children fair slightly better because paying for kids hospitals is trendy, paying for 25 year olds to be screened or even vaccinated to prevent head and neck cancers is less so. In the UK there is an NHS assumption than young people are generally well and not worth investigating. In the US they take the opposite view, that young people are inherently important and are worth over-investigating. Because missing cancer in an 80 year old is bad, but missing it in a 25 year old mother of 2 is catastrophic, economically.

What people forget is the NHS was founded in 1948 to provide care for demobilised soldiers coming out of military health cover to join the civil workforce and start making babies! It wasn't there to provide state level nursing cover for infirm octogenarians. It's also the reason why curiously the two 'young adult' services the NHS runs vaguely well are obstetrics and sexual health (GUM) - because when it was founded in the late 1940s these were priorities.

true,fdsafdaw3f3acvsda,cnty-scotland,Aberdeen,"&gt;Also, judging on the quite often articles, when people defraud money by obvious things (like claiming they can't walk, yet they do walk and it's easy to prove as soon as investigation happens) it also gives you an idea that even idiotic frauds happen, what about the ones which are more complex or in fact legal?

Benefit fraud amounts to just 0.7% of the welfare budget.  Claimant error and official errors amount to 0.9% and 0.4% respectively.  While a major overhaul in the way benefits are handled **may** have a positive effect on the amount of benefit fraud, consider the effect it may also have on claimant &amp;amp; official errors while people get used to the new system, as well as the upfront of cost of the overhaul and the fact that it is unlikely that benefit fraud could be reduced to 0%.

With that in mind, would you still advocate a change the the benefit system to prevent or reduce fraud?

&gt;Another thing is about legal benefits. As in, one person has a low paid job, doesn't bother to work more hours.

If they are working more than 16 hours they won't be eligible for JSA, nor income support.  If they are working less they will have to sign on every 2 weeks and show they are looking for more work/hours.

&gt;Spouse is ""looking after a child"" full time (even though child is in f/t education) and they get a quite decent top-up of their wages.

Couples have to work 16 hours each to qualify for childcare and tax credits.

true,skunkd,,Belfast,"&gt;It's not FIFA who determined this, people from the island of Ireland have had a birthright to Irish citizenship since 1937. Those players have been able to play for the ROI because under the eyes of the law they're as Irish as someone from Dublin, Cork or Galway.

Red herring; FIFA make the rules on eligibility, and as the Republic have extraterritorial citizenship laws they could easily make a clarification ruling out such 'land grabs'.

&gt;&gt; FAI intent on using sectarian divisions in NI to scoop up young Catholic talent.

&gt; [Brian Kerr when he was manager actively discouraged players from NI from switching](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-14473563). From that same article:

In fact the current spate of defections began under his tenure.

&gt;Players such as Alan Kernaghan and Adam Barton both come from Ulster Protestant backgrounds and both have had no problem representing the Republic. The FAI aren't pursuing some sectarian agenda.

Only reason Kernaghan went South in the 80s was that he didn't make the IFA's own strict eligibilty criteria of the time. Barton is English. That weasel Delaney stated around the time of the CAS case he thought it was the FAI's duty to select northern players, *especially young nationalists*, who wished to play for the Republic. A de facto team of nationalists, and the further segregation of Northern Irish football along religious lines.

&gt;This I agree with, The NI crest with it's shamrocks and Celtic cross is an excellent symbol for the team, I prefer the NI crest to the ROI one in fact. The IFA could easily do more to choose a uniquely NI sporting anthem but they haven't.

So shamrocks and crosses are acceptable, but loyalist symbols aren't? NI will always have a mix of symbols, it's who we are.

&gt;The FAI accepted this compromise while the IFA rejected it.

As it pisses all over the sanctity of separate FA jurisdictions it's simply incredible FIFA suggested this in the first instance. Although it suggests they didn't take the IFA's case seriously to begin with.

&gt;The only two long term solutions to this problem are an All-Ireland team or the above proposal. Since the IFA rejected both proposals they have absolutely no right to complain when a player switches to the ROI.

There was never, and there never will be, a proposal for a single team. The FAI split, they will not be allowed back in. 

&gt;I feel genuinely sorry for NI fans as their own governing body are responsible for this situation for getting as bad as it has.

A conclusion plucked out of thin air. The primary issue NI fans have with the IFA is they give up too easily. We should have zero to do with the FAI for a start.

Did you just become a fan? We had all of last season with Torres, Ba, Eto'o and they far under-preformed. Lukaku can do so much more than all three of them it's not even funny. So let's take a chance on someone who has shown they can't adapt to a new team/any pressure? I really don't understand you guys who are already sold on Costa with out a doubt. He didn't do anything any of the times I watched him in Champions League, and hasn't done a damn thing in the WC. Not impressed.

However, I can say via second-hand experience (my father's; thankfully, I have never been on the receiving end) that the word is *still* hateful, and *still* uncomfortable, for many Jews, and even in a supportive context its history is not a pleasant or positive one.

1. Manolas - Contributed to the massive attack from the Japanese but never routed. 

2. Maniatis - Down to ten but never stopped running, also broke down a lot of Japanese attacks. 

3. Samaras At least tried to make things happen when Greece did get possession

**Worst**

1. Okubo - Missed an important goal and gave away a free kick. 

2. Osako - Started bright, unable to keep up the consistency and missed some good opportunities. 

3. Honda - Not a terrible performance, but not what we expected from one of the best players from either side, unable to influence the game even when Greece had ten men, and might feel he could have done more.

&gt; Supremacism is the belief that a particular age, race, species, ethnic group, religion,gender, sexual orientation, class, belief system or culture is superior to others and entitles those who identify with it to dominate, control or rule those who do not.

Orange doctrine does not mention any of the above 'entitlements'.

true,kidfay,null,null,"Dear Brits, the way it works is most people in the US have insurance either from one's workplace (part of the ""benefits"") or through their spouse or parent. Older people who aren't working anymore have Medicare to go with Social Security. Your employer buys a group policy and the workers join on to it and the employer and employee (pre-tax) pay for it. (Part-time work and low level jobs, like minimum wage or retail, typically don't offer ""benefits"" beyond the hourly pay.) At any time you can buy your own individual health insurance but it's pricier than as a group (the ""healthcare exchange"" part of Obamacare helps to fix this--your state now has generic insurance pools you can join).

**So you've gone for treatment of some sort and you have insurance:**

* The medical facility makes up its ""dream bill"" and mails it to you and your insurance. 
* Your insurance LOLs at them and pays whatever significantly lower negotiated price they've already determined. 
* Insurance companies and hospital systems have already done a lot of this as part of them doing their business.
* (""Medical billing/entry/coding"" is a whole industry here.)
* Whatever insurance you bought determines what kind of a cost you're looking at.

You can buy cheaper insurance but is has higher ""deductibles"" (you pay first $X before insurance covers) and ""copays"" (you pay X% of the cost) and ""maximum annual out of pocket"" which means accumulating a total in a year beyond that amount your insurance would cover 100%.

My insurance is reasonable. It's around $1300 annually. Any kind of office visit is $20, specialty visit is $40, emergency room is $175 per visit, hospital stays are $50 per day, prescriptions range from $4 to 50 depending on what it is, preventative stuff is free, and the annual out of pocket max is $1500 as a single person and it'd be twice that if I had a family. The table seems to say as soon as you have a baby, the baby (which is covered as your kid) and the woman each pay the hospital stay charge. Granted, this only works as far as the hospital network extends in my part of the state.

My mom had cancer a few years ago that was a major surgery, a 10 day stay, and then chemo. The bill they sent her the first year was $140,000 but her maximum out of pocket was $2,000. Whatever her insurance paid of the $140k, $2k is certainly worth staying alive. She had to pay that amount again the next year for the rest of the chemo and a surgery.

Also, hospital stays and ambulance rides in the US are notorious for being astronomically expensive.

If you don't have insurance, then I guess this would be your bill. You probably waited until the last minute for treatment because you don't have any spare money so you had to go to the emergency room ($$$) rather than the regular doctor at a clinic ($). You could try to negotiate with the hospital to something lower. I've read that nowadays it's something like 2/3 of bankruptcies in the US are from medical expenses. And it's absurd that people in the richest country ever have to choose between average medical care they can't afford and bankruptcy. 

P.S. The UK is a wonderful country and please don't shoot the messenger. It is really unfortunate that all of us can't have this sort of coverage. People in general are kind of dumb and our country was founded as a rebellion against your government and taxes because Cowboys, Baseball, Apple Pie, and Jazz. Trying to get success out of any kind of government program here is like trying to herd cats even though buying things in bulk as groups or the government offering services that shouldn't have someone sucking profit off of makes perfect sense. Pregnant women for example are carrying our next generation of citizens. The country has an interest that all of its kids turn out as healthy and educated/productive as possible. If that means sending every pregnant woman supply packs, I say do it! We're supposedly a christian country after all.

Stuff like government services work if people approach them optimistically and people here are predisposed against that. As you can probably tell from across the pond, we have significant racism issues (the ""I'm not one of *those* people who..."" something like ""rides the (public) bus"") and have been long trained that any kind of group program or anything that comes from the government is literally the devil or a nascent Stalin coming to get you. (We're very heterogeneous here. If racism went away, then we'd probably get back to religion. If we got over than then we'd do languages or something else.)

In the UK do you ever have a sense that you're probably very remotely related to most other people you encounter since your ancestors have all been in the same country for 1000 years, like you're all very distant cousins but still cousins nonetheless? Here in the US it's a big place and we're still moving around and it's common for people to have immigrant ancestors within a few generations that came from foreign places. Outside of our families and cousins, we're all strangers to each other.

Also - Pubtran suggests the method I would also have suggested. Get the Greater Anglia train from Chelmsford to Stratford, then the Jubilee to West Ham and then, finally the c2c from West Ham to Laindon. Yes, it takes you out of the way, but it says a return via c2c will ""only"" cost around £20 for the day. I know thats not cheap, but, it gets you where you need to go with the least stress. And it only takes 1 hour and 8 minutes if you follow the app to the dot. I assume you'd need to get to work for 9, so, [here's the most appropriate journey from pubtran.](http://imgur.com/zHEilIx) 

Personally, not liking buses, i'd go for that.

Sure one person had to deal with an arsehole, but the Smashbox lady I talked with was wonderful, there's shitty sales people all over, one bad egg shouldn't ruin it for everyone. The primer is bloody brilliant, I'm certainly not going to stop using it because one person had a bad sales experience once.  

But anyway, I won't use benefit because I thought everything of theirs that I tried was crap. They're Real mascara is awful, that Porefectionist primer was useless - it was actually the wonderful Smashbox lady who told me that the only reason they have the 'best selling' mascaras and primer in the UK is because they're bloody everywhere and there's thousands of Benefit girls flogging the product. The Smashbox primer is actually the best seller if you consider the number of concession stands to sales ratio, or something to that effect, I can't remember how she explained it but it made sense at the time! I also tried the big beautiful eyes palette and the colours are terrible on me, I even tested it out in store and they insisted that it suited everyone, as soon as I sat down at home to really play with it I realised that the pink highlighter one is horrible and the concealer is orange, it looked way different in natural light compared to fluorescent shop lighting. Having said that, they do blend okay and are pigmented, so on the right person it's probably going to look fine, I'm not gonna knock something for bring the wrong colour but I've given up trying their things now. 

Also years ago I was reeled in to try a benefit blusher, I was after a new blush so said sure, I'll try it out. I wear a full caked face of slap, liquid, pressed, loose etc, and on half my face she applied moisturiser, liquid foundation, powder then the blusher. Over my already applied makeup. It was thick, sloppy and orange. I looked like Harvey Dent. I didn't even agree to it, I just wanted the blusher on but before you know it she'd started and I was too surprised to say anything. I covered my face and went home, I felt so shitty it was absolutely horrible. I avoided them for a few years then finally decided to see what the hype was and it was all just a let down. Not fussed. This is what I mean about the Smashbox thing, there's going to be bad people and you may feel shitty from a bad situation, but I wouldn't tarnish the whole brand because if it, I don't want a boycott of benefit or anything.  I'd still be willing to try Smashbox but I'd want a different artist, I'd complain and try to resolve it.

Members must have two Protestant parents and cannot be married to a Catholic, or even have any close Catholic family members. They can never enter a Catholic church for funerals, marriages and whatever else. The reason the orange order was created was to promote the suppression of Catholics through sectarian privilege and Protestant supremacy.

They might not be able to get away with open discrimination like they used too but by God they want it.

As I was/still am covered under my parents' health insurance until I'm 20-something, I wasn't paying for this directly. It was taken out of my dad's retirement. I don't recall exactly, but I want to say it was something around $1700-$1800 ish a month. I said it covered my bills, but I rarely get sick and when I do it is usually something simple. When my mother got cancer the insurance barely scratched the surface. In fact, after 4 years of my mother battling cancer one of the companies dropped her coverage. Even with all three companies, some of her prescriptions were not covered . Every month we were probably spending about $2800 a month out of pocket for pills alone. This went on for a total of 8 years until we had to put her in hospice. 

That's the story of a middle class family.

Now since I tried to emigrate to the UK (and was denied, but got to experience the amizingness of the UK for 6 months) I came back to America and started receiving government benefits. So now I have Medicaid, which is a state sponsored medical insurance for those near the poverty line (as I no longer live with my parents I now fit in this category of making less than $25k a year). Because I am under 20 I have special coverage and it is actually really good. Although, not all places accept it. In fact, I had the hardest time finding a dentist that would accept it. But with my special coverage I pay no deductible and very minimal copays. However when I turn 20, I lose this special coverage. I'm not quite sure what it is going to be like after that, but I guess I'll find out in 2 months time on my birthday.

true,Chrisischan,flair8,,"I can't argue with you that Rose may not have the talent, but a) it's arguable his situation was exacerbated by midfield problems and b) Poch has specialized in turning young players into valid talents in his system. For instance, Lallana and Rodriguez each struggled initially in the Prem with Saints, but under Poch they each became players that have come to be actively pursued by the league's top clubs. Also, because of the wide and high wingbacks, the CB's are also spread wide and consequently are more vulnerable than usual. Experience at the top, firm understanding of the system, and pace are absolutely essential to the CB's under Poch/Bielsa.

Therefore, for now, I can certainly understand why the club are putting more emphasis on physical lack rather than lack of skill. Vlad is a talented player, and has the pace to work under Poch, but I don't think he's ready yet to be a first choice Prem starter (not physical enough, and decision-making needs to improve) and a partnership of he and Jan is far too quiet. Having one highly vocal CB is absolutely essential IMO in the modern game. Teaching an already physically capable player to cross (and passing would improve with better options at LW and a fit CM) is far easier than teaching immediately what would have to be done with Vlad.

So as of the moment, I'm not at all surprised we've already been linked with multiple CB's even before the WC has gotten to elimination rounds.",0,1403225758,null,0,false,0,cic3ril,t3_280iv1,t1_cic3ril,t1_cic1jcp,null,1434317608,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Thieves were caught on CCTV snatching a sick child’s terrified pug puppy.

The hooded crooks were filmed chasing the seven-month-old pup around a car before grabbing the cowering pet and sprinting off.

Police are now appealing for help to track the two dog snatchers down.
The theft of Peaches has left Ellis Barrett, aged six, who has battled illness, “heartbroken.”

The pet had been a reward for Ellis’s bravery - after enduring four years in and out of hospital since he suffered horrendous burns as a baby.

The little boy needed surgery when he contracted septicaemia after he was accidentally scalded with hot water.

His mum, a care worker for the elderly, had worked extra shifts to buy the pet for her son in February after he left hospital.

Peaches has since become the little boy’s “best friend” - with the pair even sharing a bath together.

Ellis had been asking for the puppy since before Christmas.

But the valuable £1,000 pet was stolen from the family home in Batley, West Yorks, between around 1.20pm and 1.30pm on Sunday after she had been let out into the front garden.",0,1403226535,null,0,false,0,cic427c,t3_28lpvu,t1_cic427c,t3_28lpvu,null,1434317743,1,false,yorkshire,t5_2rz9n,1

Under the Data Protection Act 1998 he can legally request a copy of CCTV from any non-private CCTV system (you can get it from shops etc). From that footage you can acquire the licence plate of the red car and report them to the police. (you will need to have reported the incident to the police already). 

You might find the police will be willing to do this for you if you give them exact (or as close as you can get) times that he was dropped off and where. They can also access traffic cameras etc.  
It will also help you that it is not a common car. If you give a description to the police they could find it quite easily on CCTV, or even do a DVLA search for a pre-2000 red estate registered in the filton area. Any identifying features would help (plastic bumpers, damage to x area, exhaust exit left or right, wood interior, manual or automatic?). The more info you can give the better, doesnt have to be a licence plate.  

Have you reported the jeans and guitar as stolen? Have you listed the guitar on immobilise.com? If it has any distinctive features / serial numbers the police can return it if it is ever found. 

Alternatively did he have a smartphone on him? it is possible to extract cell tower location data, from which you could calculate the area ""Rob"" lived in though you would need a specialist to get that.

2. What does Schurrle turning into more dominant striker have anything to do with Costa then? We're talking about first choice striking options, so why bring Schurrle up if you don't want him to be a starter? Odd.

3. Firstly, another personal insult and I will not respond to you. Secondly, have you seen the season Benzema has had? The World Cup he's having? The only reason we're getting Costa for £32m is because he has a release clause. If he didn't have that Atletico would have demanded at least £50m. And Benzema is a more popular striker than Costa so he would most definitely cost more.

4. Well, Costa was injured early in the 2nd leg vs Barca and that injury has carried on since because it did not get the proper time it needed to heal.

&gt;Benzema is a more popular striker than Costa so he would most definitely cost more

This is hilarious. I'm fairly certain you have no idea what you're talking about. Again... If Madrid splash the amount of money they would need to for Suarez, they would most definitely have to sell a player, namely Benzema and we could swoop in for him. Notice how he was even rumored to be going to Arsenal last season? You think Arsenal would splash 60m+ on him? You're delusional.

&gt; Also I doubt you watched any of his CL games except the ones vs us

Oh really? Were you looking through my window? I like how you instantly assume I'm not telling the truth with no reason behind it other than

""Oh you're wrong, he scored a penalty against us so he obviously did something""

I'm fairly certain YOU didn't watch any of the games other than when he played against us since you aren't making any points about those games, only the game he played against us.

&gt;Even Messi has yet to score vs us.

My point wasn't that he didn't score, my point was that he didn't do a damn thing. He didn't create chances, he just floated right on the defensive line and made shitty runs. He didn't finish any of the few chances he got, and never looked good. Never looked good enough for our team, and yet again I don't see any reason for you to be so sold on him coming to CFC other than he scored a penalty and you think Benzema will be sold for 60mil+ which is just stupid.

*Edit-* After more research I'm yet to find a single rumor that has Benzema going for more than £40mil, and his 'transfermarkt' value is 27£.

And those rulings are based on most countries citizenship laws.

&gt; Only reason Kernaghan went South in the 80s was that he didn't make the IFA's own strict eligibilty criteria of the time

Well that's the IFAs own fault, but my point still stands, they wouldn't have been selected if the FAI were capping players based on whether or not they have a Nationalist or Unionist background.

&gt; That weasel Delaney stated around the time of the CAS case he thought it was the FAI's duty to select northern players, *especially young nationalists,* who wished to play for the Republic.

I would *love* to see a source for this. Although I do agree that John Delaney is a weasel.

&gt; and the further segregation of Northern Irish football along religious lines

If that was happening then Nationalist players such as Neil Lennon, Chris Baird, Sammy Clingan, Shane Ferguson, Paddy McCourt, Ryan McLaughlin and self-confessed Republic fan Niall McGinn would never have made themselves available for the NI team. If the IFA hadn't dragged their heels for so long about symbols you'd have more Nationalist players turning out for NI.

&gt; So shamrocks and crosses are acceptable, but loyalist symbols aren't?

No they're not, neither are republican symbols. The Celtic Cross, Shamrock and Harp are well known as cross community symbols.

&gt; As it pisses all over the sanctity of separate FA jurisdictions 

If the IFA were that worried about the NI team/identity being somehow ""diluted"" then they wouldn't have capped so many foreign-born players. How would the mutual eligibility proposal be detrimental??, they'll still be pulling on an NI shirt at the end of the day.

&gt; it suggests they didn't take the IFA's case seriously to begin with.

That's because the IFA never had a case to begin with. Their whole argument rested on a ""gentlemens agreement"" that allegedly existed between the FAI and IFA, the IFA were asked to produce evidence of this agreement and they didn't. that's why the CAS and FIFA ruled in favour of the FAI.

Since you like the IFA seem to be reluctant to compromise then you have no right to complain when a player switches.

&gt; A conclusion plucked out of thin air.

How is it??, the point I made is that genuine NI fans are being made to suffer because the IFA are being incredibly bitter and about the whole situation; they created the situation and then complain when it comes back to bite them.

&gt;  We should have zero to do with the FAI for a start.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Same. I am an England fan. I know expectations were low but let's compare Roy to BR. In the Italy game England had a great chance it was worked well into a dangerous area and unlucky to not score *pan to RH sitting on the bench with his face in his hands* what does that do?! Instills in the players that they aren't doing it right or blaming luck. So they deviate from a successful approach. 

BR would have been up in the box applauding the effort. Positively reinforcing attacking play. In turn players notice it and believe they are on the right path.  

Again back to low expectations. The world cup is not a platform to ""try and see where we get"" it only comes around every 4 years. It's okay to convey that message to the fans to lower expectations and pressure but behind closed doors it should be completely different story. Players are lucky to get one go at it. The World Cup is the pinnacle in this sport. Sitting on your arse with your face in your hand is not the way to do it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Not at all, as /u/ibpants mentioned people will feel bad for talking about his weaknesses, but the city team of back then was a very different one. We were playing attacking football but Anelka was our only real standout player at that time.

 We finished mid-table and we really over-achieved since we'd just got promoted the season before. It was good though before Keegan fucked it all up by signing 30 year old has-beens on 5 year deals. It's easy to draw comparisons but Toure is on another level entirely.

 I'd also add that Keegan wouldn't have moved Foe up if it wasn't for the fact Benarbia's age had really caught up to him once we got promoted and Berkovic mainly played on the wing, so I don't think it was a move Keegan wanted to take.

 It's easy watching youtube montages that can make Heskey look like Messi and jumping to conclusions, especially since his death was so tragic, but there's no real need to compare him to Toure, he was a good player and that's enough really. 

Also this isn't really related but I have to point out that 12 years ago doesn't really mean you're a 'city long-timer.'

I liked her a lot in Asylum of the Daleks, but as for her appearances after that, the entire reason she's ""interesting"" is because the Doctor, a character who either knows or can properly interpret everything within the span of a single episode, calls her impossible and can't figure out what her deal is.

Her only other distinguishing feature is her willingness to back-talk the Doctor, which frankly we've seen in more auxiliary characters (Jack, Rose's mum) from whom it came off as petulant.

As if the self-reflexive ""she's interesting because she's interesting wasn't bad enough"", the resolution of that logical loop was completely unsatisfying. Clara jumped into the Doctor's timestream whatsit in order to fulfill her trumped up destiny for no reason beyond ""well he's just such a swell guy, it would be terrible if something bad happened to him"".

The other companions' personal story arcs had some sort of personal motivation, however weak. Clara, by virtue of being diluted by existing multiple times, didn't really have anything going for her outside of her interactions with the Doctor. 

Rose's arc was to become something more than a suburban chav, to get over the inevitability of her father's death, and then to reunite her family. Martha, despite her noble intentions and brave aspirations, needed to learn how to proverbially put her own oxygen mask on before helping others, ultimately deciding that she could do the most good for the world by prioritizing self-preservation over the opportunity to save whole worlds and likely die or disappear with the Doctor. Amy needed to uncover the mystery of her lonely childhood and learn that the hero childhood hero was not only dangerous and untrustworthy, but indirectly responsible for her lonely childhood (via the Tardis cracks being responsible for the disappearance of her family).

Clara didn't change, aside from through deus ex machina. Her vaunted intelligence was the result of the botched spoonhead attack, and not something she brought to the table herself. Her arc was to become the answer to the question ""Why is Clara interesting?"". The reveal of Clara-through-time was too fast, too much tell and not enough show, saved only by the reveal of John Hurt in the final moments.

Lazy, lazy writing.

EDIT : forgot Donna, unforgivably. Her story arc was not unlike Rose's, only her banter was better.

true,safewinter,cnty-england,England,"There's a myriad of reasons really. I'll outline a few (my own opinions of course)

- Roy Hodgson is a poor coach
- The 'English Brand' of football became outdated a few decades ago (rough and tumble physical football) and we have failed to adapt because we Brits sure don't like change
- We are relying too heavily on 'established' players who never really shone on the international stage anyway ( i.e Gerrard and Rooney)
- Our young and exciting players are exactly that, too young. Sterling, Sturridge, Barkely, Wilshere, Lallana and Henderson have not established themselves in the England side yet, but they've been thrust into the biggest stage of all anyway.
- Our defense is nervous and lacks leadership. Having top quality communication and chemistry is absolutely vital, something England do not have.
- English players failing to make an impact abroad narrows the pool. England has the highest percentage of players that play domestically in their own country (22/23). Whereas other countries are shipping their players off all over the world allowing for far more of them to develop, and get a much wider scope in terms of approaches to football
- Expectation. There is as much pressure on England as pretty much any other country, despite not earning it at all.
- No real continuity in personnel, formation, or philosophy. Going through managers and formations like a 15 year old goes through kleenex hampers any attempt to have a solid team chemistry and structure in place.
- Natural cycles. No team will always be the best. Spain for example had a dizzying high that looks set to hit the ground hard. It's completely expected that England will have natural down periods.",0,1403233584,null,0,false,0,cic6uod,t3_28lj88,t1_cic6uod,t3_28lj88,null,1434319057,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

There will always be people who look at you as an outsider or a ""plastic"" because you're trying to support a club so far away, but that's down to the almost clan-like culture around football in the UK and most other football mad nations. America isn't one of those nations so it's natural you'll gravitate towards something that's both accessible and fun to watch over any deep ties or history (though that may come later when you learn more about the game and clubs), and having seen your other post after watching the England game earlier, that's what you've done. Even though they lost you picked up on players doing things you liked and looked into it further, noticed Liverpool, and decided to see how that goes. A natural progression for an ""outsider"" so to speak.

But do look into your local MLS team too - the only way football thrives is if local communities get into it, support and build their local teams, and make a lot of noise about it. I don't know if the Chicago Fire are any good or not but that doesn't matter - they represent your city and your communities. You can still stick your Liverpool shirt on in time to catch the game over here thanks to the time difference and I don't see Liverpool and Chicago developing a fierce intercity rivalry any time soon.

true,AmericanSteve,null,null,"The team that you play with makes a huge difference in the statistics that you put up. Messi has played with Barcelona for essentially his entire career. Ronaldo had played with Manchester United and Real Madrid. Suarez has played with Ajax and Liverpool. 

Ajax and Liverpool are very good teams but they were substantially less than what Ronaldo and Messi came up in. With Liverpool's rise in quality, there are other payers on the field that require attention from the back line and Suarez's stats reflect this. Suarez in the last year was every bit as good as Messi or Ronaldo.

One of the reasons for Suarez being outscored is that Liverpool has Gerrard to take PKs and set pieces in the offensive third. If Suarez was taking these instead of Gerrard he would have at least 10 goals more. Suarez also has far more assists than either Ronaldo or Messi. Rodgers stresses total team goals and has Suarez scoring and creating goals for others. If you want to build a winning team your first pick is going to be a striker with the highest total goals and assists rather than individual goals. 

I am not going to argue that Suarez is better than Messi or Ronaldo but there is a very credible argument that he is on par with either of them.

true,CourtshipDate,eng-northhamptonshire,Norfants,"Ultimately for me it's down to the coaching at youth level. At ages 8-14 kids should be taught technical skills. They should be encouraged to be comfortable with a ball at their feet and comfortable passing it around and moving to find space to receive the ball. That's what's done in Spain, Germany, France, South America. It's only us that sticks with an outdated form of teaching football and it hasn't got us anywhere.

There should be a lesser emphasis on winning and more emphasis on enjoying the game. I certainly would've enjoyed playing youth football more if it was small games of 5-a-side on small pitches that encouraged passing, movement and ball skills.

Our leagues are well-regarded because the world's best players come to play there. But they're all South American, or European. None of the best are English and it says a lot about a footballing nation when none of our players go and play abroad. I think we're the only nation that can say that. It suggests that our players aren't good enough to go and play in countries where their home-grown players are taught a different footballing philosophy.

Ed: Oh and it should be said that apart from a 1966 when we won on home soil, our record in major tournaments has been mediocre. IMO the worst thing that has happened to English football is winning in 66, because since then it's always meant huge pressure for each team going into a tournament.",0,1403237555,null,0,1403237908,0,cic8da0,t3_28lj88,t1_cic8da0,t3_28lj88,null,1434319771,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That works best if there's a counterattack with players in advanced positions and spaces in the opposition defence. Uraguay defended pretty deep and were very well organised, just like most average teams that do well (remember Greece when they won the Euros?).

Gerrard was at fault for the goal and is somewhat prone to giving away costly goals. He did the same in the Chelsea game and generally does one or two of those a season. It's perhaps no more than a sideeffect of going for so many defensive balls. People like Lucas also make similar errors from time to time.

However in the commentary a lot of the blame for the killer goal was quite rightly assigned to the defenders. They had one job, one fucking job in that situation. Either Gerrard heads it up the field or it gets past him. The first one is more likely usually but they have to cover the second, it's not like there's anything for them to do in scenario one. Ballwatchers. Suarez trotted past them while they were standing still.

Perhaps the biggest difference between us and our opponents so far this world cup has been finishing. They simply get more goals for the attacks they make. To some extent it's final ball but the finish has been lacking.

Rooney was unlucky with the header that hit the angle and took his goal well but there were too many chances in both games that weren't taken.
