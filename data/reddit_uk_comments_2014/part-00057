Not going to lie, a little worried about the Lamps-Ramires pairing in midfield. I don't know how well we're going to hold possession that much with these two, so we're probably with a defensive and counter-attacking style of play, especially with the attackers we have up front. Torres, Hazard, Willian and Schurrle all have pace and will most try to use that to catch the Gala defense off guard. 

I don't know how much I like the Terry-Luiz pairing especially because of the different play styles of the two. I think Jose is going to use Luiz to ""bully"" Gala's front, especially with Drogs being physical. 

I think this team, especially Hazard and Willian, can and will scrape a goal or two just by simply doing something magical on the counter-attack, but our defense will let in a goal as well.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Facisim is more than just nationalism and socialism.

Certainly. I wouldn't even select Germany under the Nazis as prototypical fascism, Mussolini's Italy was a much more ""pure"" fascist State.

&gt;Hell I'd say in many ways Stalin was more fascist than Hitler.

I don't know about _more fascist_, but I'd have no issue with calling both Hitler's Germany and Stalin's USSR totalitarian regimes.  There are specific characteristics of fascism which Stalin's regime didn't manifest, albeit Hitler's Germany did, however Nazism is a fairly specific flavour of fascism in itself, and quite unique as compared to other fascist and quasi-fascist regimes like Italy under Benito, Imperial Japan, Dollfuß' Austria, Metaxas' Greece, Salazar's Portugal, Ustašean Croatia, Franco's Spain, Pinochet's Chile, and those of some other Latin American and Eastern European countries.

&gt;as for your assertion that there wasn't ethnic cleansing under Stalin, well my girl friend just said something very rude, revisionist would be a summary (she is mixed ethnicity, one part of her family were almost completely cleansed.). Let's just say for all those related to Holodomor, I would let it be classified as a genocide.

I take it she's part Ukrainian then?  Yeah, I'm on the fence over it given the circumstances and the technical definition, but I'm certainly not trying at revisionism and my sympathies lie substantially with Ukraine given the earlier history and my own politics (i.e. Makhno and his black army is about as near as I get to hero worship, and I certainly wish Free Ukraine hadn't been betrayed and bought under the yoke).

&gt;I've often thought if people just used totalitarianism instead of facisim it would clear up things, wikipedia actually defines it as a kind of subset of facisim after all.

I kind of addressed this above, and we probably substantially agree on it.

Re your questions, I love it. I think it's a fantastic service. Waiting lists are not something I've ever been troubled by. I might have to wait a couple of days to see a doctor, but emergency stuff is generally drop in, wait fifteen minutes, get called through and get put back together. Pros? Excellent quality service from passionate and caring staff. Cons? Non in my experience to speak of. Cost, I don't really care hugely about. I pay 25% of my earnings to tax, which isn't an amount that concerns me much, considering all the things it pays for.

I'd take the NHS over America's system any day. In Edinburgh, there's a museum of all the old medical equipment and all the old procedures that physicians used to rely on in decades, sometimes centuries ago.

 ""I am delighted to be honoured by Liverpool FC with a testimonial match and particularly thrilled that Olympiakos have accepted my invitation to play the fixture,"" said the England captain.

""Last time we met proved to be such a memorable game both for me personally and Liverpool Football Club.

""I am looking forward to what I know will be a fantastic game and a wonderful occasion."" 

An open letter from the president of Olympiacos, Evangelos Marinakis on the day does mention the affinity between the two clubs:

""We are delighted to be part of this event for so many reasons.

Steven Gerrard is one of the finest footballers in the world, and it is fantastic to see today a club able to support a player with a testimonial after 15 years with them - but all the more so when the player is also able to play for his hometown team and achieve so much including becoming captain of club and country.

I have been a lifelong Olympiacos fan, as was my father before me, so I know only too well the pride and special feeling of being able to be part of the team that brings success to the club you've supported all of your life.

Steven may have selected Olympiacos for that special goal and all it meant to him and went on to mean, but I feel the clubs have a very special resonance and connection.

Olympiacos are a side from the port city Piraeus - today part of the wider Athens - the fans are famous for being the best and most passionate in Greece, creating a fantastic atmosphere in our stadium. Without any question it is their passion and commitment that has so often been the extra player that has cheered on their team in red and white to being the most successful club in Greece, reaching our 40th league title this year.

So it is perhaps easy to understand why Liverpool FC are very popular with many Olympiacos fans and why when I personally came to the UK to live for a while when I was younger and why I was so naturally drawn towards supporting Liverpool - as I still do today - as the connections and similarities are so clear and strong.

The clubs have been further bonded by their respective tragedies. I know all Olympiacos fans feel huge unity with Liverpool fans in the campaign for justice for the 96 as we have suffered our gate 7 tragedy where 21 supporters lost their lives just over 30 years ago.

We are equally delighted Steven has chosen to donate his proceeds from this match to the Steven Gerrard Foundation, a registered charity which helps disadvantaged children. This reinforces the feeling of common understanding as we will be donating our proceeds to similar charities in Greece to aid children who are in dire need of support today.

So for so many reasons when we were asked to take part, it was a very easy and quick decision.

We would like to offer our congratulations to Steven for a fantastic career so far and wish him a wonderful evening ""

If we remember Sherwood's background and acknowledge that he is most likely only a caretaker, he HAS done a great job (even if lately he's regressed), ESPECIALLY with Ade.

And to Hughton's criticism of Van Gaal, I agree again. I think it's poor form to openly speak of someone else's job, especially when the seat is as hot as Sherwood's. Managers know how difficult the job is and should be respectful of their peers (Sherwood, even on a temporary basis, being Van Gaal's peer).

This may lead to a ""its ok, I didnt hurt them/there was no lasting harm"" mentality by way of rationalising what - as you say - most people know is an illegal act. I do think there is perhaps a disconnect between understanding the illegality of rape versus understanding the damage and harm it causes.

Ah, no, I don't think communism is evil, I just think we are, and we'll never have any workable form of communism which doesn't require totalitarianism.

I've never heard any egalitarian concept that solves division of resources.  I mean ultimately you can still have it will people.  I think people are masters of inequality.  Hookups at the union bar were always my example of this, it started as a joke chatup line, but I've never heard anyone address it.  People who are good looking and beautiful, on average, create good looking and beautiful kids, people who are ugly, on average have a much less chance of hooking up with someone beautiful.  This is elitism in it's finest.  (this is when I'd normally suggest she buy me a drink to prove she isn't elitist, I've grown up a lot since I was teen, honest.).

However something as simple as that on average holds true.

You also have the idea of land.  There are certain parts of this earth I love more than others, some only at specific times of the year, I am sure many people share some of them.  How do you share it out?  How do you solve the fact that for society to have the things it needs, it requires certain skills in certain places.  People who have those skills might not want to be there.  You'll end up with a form of inequality.  Last time someone asked me to work in Dubai for three months... Well let's just say they offered more than they'd pay in London and I turned it down, call me weird if you wish, but I hate Dubai.  How do you allocate the resources when they have predisposition to being in a place?

Then we get onto the whole efficiency and innovation around need thing.

So those are my big issues with communism, the problem is I think these are critical design flaws, rather than implementation issues.  As a side note, I would honestly believe a free market would make a far more efficient machine for genocide than communism, the fact we see so little of it in a capitalist society is genocide it is itself inefficient.

true,paleogirl,mccoy,McCoy,"&gt; The whole season 6 finale with ""Doctor in a Doctor suit!"" was weak to me.

Would you be willing to expand on this? I found it immensely satisfying, as it flawlessly solved the potential paradox without resorting to the use of a *deus ex machina*. 

The season setup lent itself to hours of enjoyable online fannish speculation (I had money down on a Ganger being involved in the plot resolution, myself). All of the information that we, as viewers, needed to solve the riddle was freely given to us over the course of the series, and yet very few people guessed correctly. 

Same thing in Series 5. What a beautiful shock when a brief flash of the Doctor appearing in *Flesh and Stone* with his jacket on (after having previously been in shirtsleeves) turned out to be part of the eventual resolution of the series arc in *The Big Bang*! I remember some fans bitching about this ""continuity error"" while others constructed elaborate scenarios to explain it. We spent the rest of the series watching with eagle eyes for other, similar oddities-- and what a payoff we eventually got. I still get shivers when Amy leans forward and says ""Something borrowed... something blue"", and the wine glasses begin to tremble.

I take intense satisfaction from knowing that with Moffat, the finale won't be some sort of cringe-inducing, out-of-nowhere piece of randomness. (""If we all chant his name, Dobby!Doctor will be restored to Tinkerbell Jesus!Doctor and save the day!"") (""There happen to be a couple of knobs on this random console that cancel the detonation of the reality bomb! And oh, look-- the same knobs can make all he Daleks spin around comically! Good thing Donna suddenly knows exactly how to use them!"")

Don't get me wrong-- I love a lot of the stuff Rusty did; *Turn Left, Midnight*, and *Torchwood: Children of Earth* rate as some of the best television out there. But god, I used to *hate* his series finales. I was literally throwing wadded up napkins at the TV screen during the interminable *End of Time* goodbye scenes, yelling ""Just die already, you whiny, self-involved prat!""

Give me a bittersweet goodnight from a ghost from the past, and and a hint of nobility and acceptance any day of the week.

Technically, the council is borrowing money at a lower interest rate compared to the loan they are providing to the project. I wouldn't be surprised if at some point the project goes bust and the council ends up owning the tower, hopefully with most of the loan paid off.

In computer science authorization is the process of qualifying if a given user should be allowed to complete the operation they've requested to perform (not to be confused with authentication which is verifying if a person IS who they claim to be). In this case as the system gave these users access they were by definition authorized. Authorized by the server but not the customer. 

The customers in this situation were completely unable to be part of the authorization process because they were not even made aware of the fact that it existed. The authorization process that their supplier set up for them was short-sighted, unadvertised and its default was insecure.

Unexpected yes, permitted by the customer explicitly, no. Authorized, by the server, yes. As I said, I was being pedantic over terminology.

&gt; But the person didn't. 

But remember that the machine is functioning on their behalf. It is their agent, their advocate. This area of legality is going to pose a ton of problems in the future. If I can be prosecuted for setting up a machine that is torrenting a film then why am I not responsible if a server that is acting on my behalf authenticates the wrong user?

I'm not defending it, the morality of the phone hacking was wrong I'm merely stating that the simple legal view that only people count isn't going to last for much longer.

Story time. My uncle (when i was a baby) fell from the 6th floor balcony on holiday, and landed on the tiles by the pool. Got up, went back upstairs and carried on his partying with barely a scratch. 

A few weeks later he was coming back in to his house from work, tripped on the lip of the doorstep and died instantly. 


Sometimes people fall great distances and live, and sometimes they take a slight tap and die. Sometimes people get shot to fuck and live, sometimes people get punched once and die. 



The guy went down for manslaughter because of the incident. He punched someone in the head like a coward, and they died. 

as I said in another post, when you compare the amount of people killed, and the amount of people punched once, it will be extremely unbelievably hard to find points in which the 2 cross over.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"Well, since I'm not a communist it doesn't really behove me to prove it's possible!  In fact, I've usually made similar points to you about the seemingly insurmountable issue of natural scarcity.  My line is generally that communism appears a fabulous ideal for a post-scarcity society, so please come back to me when we have one.  On the other hand, I think there are a few fallacies in your post above, and in order to illustrate these properly, I'm going to have to, temporarily, take up the defence of communism.

&gt;I don't think communism is evil, I just think we are

Firstly, we meet the old ""human nature"" canard, which I don't think is as convincing an argument as the people who present it believe it is.  At best, it is a statement of faith, or rather, given the side of the metaphorical fence you seem to fall, of cynicism.  There have been great philosophical debates which have raged throughout history, and I could cite a long list of deep thinkers on either side, but to simplify it's really Hobbes versus Rousseau, and neither side has carried the day.  In more recent times, since the advent of science, people have tried to rally that to their side - the survival of the fittest and social Darwinism versus Kropotkin's Mutual Aid - but again neither has triumphed, and again, despite the evident truths revealed by our selfish genes, modern scientists have [conceded this](http://www.marxists.org/subject/science/essays/kropotkin.htm), and, indeed, the latest research in game theory provides [strong evidence of the survival value of cooperative strategies](http://digitaljournal.com/article/355734).  The reality is that human nature is complex and multifarious, and neither one thing (evil, ugly, competitive) nor the other (good, beautiful, cooperative).

&gt;I've never heard any egalitarian concept that solves division of resources. I mean ultimately you can still have it will people. I think people are masters of inequality.

Secondly, you have the assumption that communism/socialism is about exact equality.  It is not and it has never been. Socialism is broadly about workers deciding how the surplus value they create is distributed - and they can notionally distribute this in as unequal a manner as they wish.  Communism is about the community as a whole determining how their resources are distributed, again not necessarily equally, but according to need.

&gt;Then we get onto the whole efficiency and innovation around need thing.

Thidly, here I'd like to introduce you to [the Inefficiency of Capitalism](https://libcom.org/files/Sheppard-Inefficiancy-read.pdf).  Or, just as a TLDR example, consider the vast numbers of homeless people in many capitalist societies whilst masses of housing stock lies empty and unoccupied; or the vast numbers of factories and other resources which sit idle, machine tools disintegrating into rusted piles, stock gathering dust, whilst millions of people have no meaningful work - not because people don't want things, on the contrary, but because they haven't the means with which to pay at a price which makes sufficient profit for the small number of capitalists who control the means of production.

As for innovation, remember, it wasn't free market capitalism which brought you the computer, the Internet, the commercial airliner, etc., neither will it bring you a cure for cancer.  These things require long term planning and communal action.  Capitalism is great for innovating a slightly different phone handset or a slightly different drug formulation and cranking out millions of copies, it's less good at breaking new ground, especially when it's risky and expensive.",0,1393445180,null,0,false,0,cfpf6l5,t3_1yzxgl,t1_cfpf6l5,t1_cfpdwc0,null,1432571952,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

BBC programmes can still pull in 5-10 million viewers? That's viewers, not subscribers who might or might not be watching the same programmes on Netflix.. So it's not even close.. yet! Maybe when Netflix produces more original content, the depth and breadth of what they make currently isn't even close to what the BBC puts out, hardly surprising given how much older and larger the BBC is.

http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/aug/21/netflix-uk-subscribers-internet-video

http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-30

We have no stats on the amount Netflix subscribers use their service. I guess what viewers could do is work out how many shows they watch per year, how much they pay for Netflix per year, and how much it would cost to buy or rent the DVDs for example, to decide if that's good value. Then you have other factors like convenience, and the illlegal methods.

edit: i found some stats for NetFlix US - average one hour to 75 minutes a day! that's far less than US TV viewers

true,aeisenst,num5,,"While I agree the players haven't been putting in the necessary effort, I think the players aren't moving much because they don't have clear direction as to what they're supposed to do. This was especially apparent after Capoue got injured, and we were stuck with a central midfield of Paulinho, Dembele, and Bentaleb. Obviously, somebody needs to stay back to cover. Who was that? Chadli likes to cut in. Is Rose supposed to cover the width? If so, who's going to cover that back wide spot? Where's the focus of our attack? Is Dembele going to cover the space behind the striker? If so, if Bentaleb or Paulinho comes up, where are they supposed to go to not eat all of his space?

Other teams have clear direction, so they feel that they have the liberty to move around. It's easy to make forward runs when you know that there's a midfielder covering behind you. It's easy to run into space if you know space is going to be there, not filled by another player. 

You can't just stick a bunch of players into similar positions and tell them all to play their natural games. Even with Redknapp's famous ""Run around a bit"" directions, the team selection made sense to allow the players to express themselves. Usually put Crouch up front to nod the ball on, with VdV behind him. Modric sat back, knowing he could spray the ball around, while also moving forward, trusting that Sandro or Palacios would be behind him. Bale and Lennon played wide wings, but could cut in because they had clear coverage from their fullbacks, with the holding midfielder in position to cover for them. It made logical sense.

I realise that when we were watching Torres at the time he was mostly on his own up there but that meant that nearly all attacks went through him, Sturridge does have much more attacking players around him, but that also means sharing the goals. When Sturridge had to play up front on his own in a defensive team, stint at Bolton/our first three games this season, he exceeded. 

Torres scored 18 in 33, 14 in 24, 18 in 22 and then 9 in 24

Sturridge has 10 in 14 and now 18 in 19!

Strikers are strikers and they should mostly be based on their goals but Sturridge also has twice as many assists as Torres so if your argument is general play that's a good indicator of what Sturridge can give you.

Not necessarily.  45 years *minimum* is a **long time** - bear in mind it's 45 years until he can even *apply* for parole, let alone be considered, let alone be released.

For all we know, the parole officers responsible for that decision might not even be born yet.  I suppose he could get seriously ill in later years and be released on compassionate grounds **if and only if** he's no longer seen as a threat to the public.

Also, consider that he would be ""on licence"" as we call it in Scotland.

On this issue of biased media it genuinely strikes me as a case of *""beauty is in the eye of the beholder""*, wherein it is easier for pro-independence minded people to see the inequity of pro-union news. But the reverse can also be said, in all honesty I actually think that considering Alex Salmond is only a regional leader and David Cameron is the prime minister for the entire UK the media are actually very generous in some of the coverage they give Salmond. They often pitch Scotland topics from a ""Salmond Said -- Cameron Said"" point of view, which strictly speaking they don't have to do. You might argue its only fair, but its actually also a form of bias - because in doing so they are elevating Salmond onto a single platform with the prime minister, who occupies a higher office. 

At any rate, it doesn't matter whether Scotland are independent or not, regardless of their choice on September 18th they will **still** be in the shadow of the huge economic and cultural giant to their south, and at the periphery of Europe effectively forced either way to do business (geographically) ""through"" England. In a sense, it strikes me that the yes and no vote is actually tantamount to a case of *""like it or lump it""*. You could say that is unfair, but that is the way the world works. The UK and Europe used to dominate global culture. Now the US does. It isn't unfair, it's just the nature of things, and regardless of what happens in that referendum the Scots will always have to deal with the fact that their closest neighbor is much larger both economically and geographically. I actually think that if Scots want to improve their lives they probably stand a better chance of doing it in the union than they do out of it... although I live in the SE of England so am largely ambivalent to the outcome.

Not sure if we were watching the same episode.  There's no assumption about the power of the Time Lords to address the paradox, the Doctor himself said that only they had the power to change his future so I think it's pretty explicit.

And the whole underlying story line was about the Time Lords threatening to return to their home universe, and the rest of the universe saying No.  

If there's a question of continuity for me, it's wondering how the Time Lords were supposed to be frozen in a moment in time in the previous episode, and were now apparently quite active.

I vote UKip and would absolutely love to see these two pricks hanging at the bottom of a rope, and would take enjoyment in seeing the life slowly fade away from them. They are ABSOLUTE SCUM BAGS who hate our country, our culture, what we stand for and the democracy we have. They will NEVER be of ANY benefit to our society, and being British born, one of them madly to a Christian family... we cannot deport them anywhere either. 

So we have two people in prison now, who genuinely despise and hate our way of life, will never be productive members of society in it, and we can only go to work, paying taxes, knowing some of our work is helping feed and clothe these two. It's severely anger inducing if you really think about it. 

I just hope somebody smashed their TV screen in prison and then cuts their fucking eyes out, half crippling them in the process by cutting their throat so they live in pain while we pay for them to live. I ABSOLUTELY DESPISE AND WISH THE WORST UPON THESE MEN. It's revengeful thinking, I know it is. I'm proud to say it is. 

I love my country and the options available for me to better myself as a person and in regard to wealth. We're one of the best nations on the planet, for these pricks to go against that and for that ideology to end up in murder of a soldier, who would be our first point of defence if Europe started to get their backs up again, which due to the fact that the majority of our laws come from the EU these days, you can make a strong argument we're not a sovereign nation any more, that could be a reality, for the third time.. although I digress.

If UKip voters want these two pricks hung drawn and quartered, so what? Sitting up on your morale high ground as if you're above human nature and with that, in essence not human.. You have to question why. Without bullshitting, the left has this 'its not the criminals fault', which plays into the right wing 'so its the victims fault which is what the left says', and I don't believe in any of that bullshit. 

What I do know though, is that these men are adults and acted from an adult mind, made the decisions they did to do what they have done, and now MY TAXES are feeding them, and it disgusts me.

true,JeffMartinsMandolin,null,null,"For me, I'm English and British. Like some others have said I'll use either. I live in Germany and England/English happens to be easier to say in German, also people tend to recognise that I'm British so I'll tell them I'm English for clarification. On Reddit it's not usually so necessary to clarify. ""British"" suffices to explain my point of view most of the time. I try to be particular about things where it matters, for example if I'm talking about education or healthcare, my experience usually relates only to England, but if it's politics or something, we all have the same government (at the moment...) so I might as well refer to Britain.

I've also described myself as ""European"" on Reddit more than a few times when sharing experiences common to Britain and Germany because people don't always need to know exactly which countries I'm talking about.

For some people it's more complicated anyway. My boyfriend, for example, was born in Australia but with equal British citizenship through his mother. He moved to England aged 12 and lived there until the age of 23. He and I currently live abroad but he considers Britain to be his home now. However he has no English ancestry - his mother is Scottish. He can't claim to be English, and he's never lived in Scotland, so he pretty much has to just be British (and Australian.)",0,1393448960,null,0,1393449207,0,cfph6t3,t3_1z0eqa,t1_cfph6t3,t3_1z0eqa,null,1432572897,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7

While it is often presumed that the council is financing the tower with £36 million of local taxpayers' money, in actuality the council is 'merely' underwriting an external loan to the i360 developers - the tower is a private development, being built on a private plot of land - from the national Public Works Loan Board. 

This is a nationally funded body which funds big-arse building projects, and nothing else: if £36 million wasn't being spent on the Tower, the council wouldn't suddenly have an extra £36 million to spend on frontline services etc. 

The council effectively acts as a conduit for private developers to access a central government loan: central government pays the council the money, which is immediately passed on to the private developers. At the end of loan's 25 year life (or sooner if the attraction is unexpectedly popular) the council will have gained £21m through being a middle man.

Of course, in a worst case scenario the i360 development company goes bust. If that happened, the council, as the underwriter to the loan, will have to take on ownership and management of the tower: problematic, but at the very least the council would acquire the leasehold to prime real estate it didn't have before.

Otherwise, all going well, the only local tax payermoney spent on the project will be on traffic management and the like. Central government seems intent on spending national taxpayers' money on big penis shaped objects, and if one ain't built in Brighton, something similar will be built somewhere else, at the same cost to you.

Local councils are only responsible for roads outside of the ""strategic road network"". Most motorways and ""A"" roads are part of this and are maintained by the Highways Agency, which is also funded from central government.

""Road tax"" (Vehicle Excise Duty) is not ""ringfenced"" for road/transport spending. Around 10-15bn per year is spent on road maintenance and improvement and maybe another 8-10bn on road policing. VED raises around 30bn, so considering that there are many other ways that money is spent in ways that benefit road users (e.g. investment in other forms of transport helps reduce congestion), it seems that VED more-or-less ""breaks even"" for road users.",0,1393450547,null,0,false,0,cfpi1vd,t3_1yz6xm,t1_cfpi1vd,t1_cfp6tyx,null,1432573304,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The last 30 or so minutes was absolutely dreadful. Missing passes, losing the ball way too easily, and the players generally just looked like they couldn't give less of a fuck. Meanwhile, Gala is dominating us throughout the field, and looking somewhat dangerous. Absolutely disgraceful.

I don't normally get too upset about games, or football in general, but such a pathetic display is just infuriating to watch. Nobody played like they wanted it, except maybe Schurrle and Willian. 

Mourinho shouldn't be okay with 1-0 against Galatasary. Every other major contender in the competition won comfortably against equal or better opponents, hell we watched RM put away 6 today. There's no excuse for us to look so lethargic, so bored, in the FUCKING KNOCKOUT STAGES OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE.

&gt;The **uncanny valley** is a hypothesis in the field of human aesthetics which holds that when human features look and move almost, but not exactly, like natural human beings, it causes a response of [revulsion](http://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/revulsion) among some human observers. Examples can be found in the fields of [robotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics),  [3D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics) [computer animation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_animation),   and in medical fields such as burn reconstruction, infectious diseases, neurological conditions, and plastic surgery.  The ""valley"" refers to the dip in a graph of the comfort level of humans as subjects move toward a healthy, natural human likeness described in a [function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics\)) of a subject's aesthetic acceptability.

Capital punishment has been proven not to be a deterrent against murder, nor is it financially viable compared with whole life sentences. The burden of proof is far below a safe level for convictions, not to mention there has been too many miscarriages of justice to ever consider such a barbaric punishment.

&gt; They are ABSOLUTE SCUM BAGS who hate our country, our culture, what we stand for and the democracy we have. They will NEVER be of ANY benefit to our society, and being British born, one of them madly to a Christian family... we cannot deport them anywhere either.

No one is disputing that they are scum bags, and it's safe to assume they will not directly benefit society but that does not give a nation the right to murder them. Such a view on imprisoned people is regressive and dangerous. To advocate killing these two men, a crime in  which they now serve life for, opens the flood gates for abuse. Also the fact you even mention deportation (and their religion) suggests an undertone of racism or intolerance, both of which are unfit for measured thought.

&gt;I love my country...

Yet you are happy to see it murder?

&gt;and the options available for me to better myself as a person and in regard to wealth. We're one of the best nations on the planet...

Evidence? The UK is more desirable than Somalia for example, but your claim is arrogant and far from the truth.

&gt;for these pricks to go against that and for that ideology to end up in murder of a soldier, who would be our first point of defence if Europe started to get their backs up again, which due to the fact that the majority of our laws come from the EU these days, you can make a strong argument we're not a sovereign nation any more, that could be a reality, for the third time.. although I digress.

[Only 7% of legislation is from the EU](https://fullfact.org/factchecks/proportion_of_uk_law_made_by_eu-3073) and a lot of UKIP voters forget that HRA, while it subjects the land to EU laws, policy and directives, it can always be repealed ergo Parliament is always sovereign.


&gt; I just hope somebody smashed their TV screen in prison and then cuts their fucking eyes out, half crippling them in the process by cutting their throat so they live in pain while we pay for them to live. I ABSOLUTELY DESPISE AND WISH THE WORST UPON THESE MEN. It's revengeful thinking, I know it is. I'm proud to say it is.

Justice is blind, and does not seek revenge...perhaps if you love your country so much you can share this value?

&gt;If UKip voters want these two pricks hung drawn and quartered, so what? Sitting up on your morale high ground as if you're above human nature and with that, in essence not human.. You have to question why. Without bullshitting, the left has this 'its not the criminals fault', which plays into the right wing 'so its the victims fault which is what the left says', and I don't believe in any of that bullshit.

There is no morals in premeditated murder, which you advocate and this further shows how out of touch UKIP supporters are. Perhaps you would do better in a country which disregards human life and dignity to pursuit of your (frankly) fascist ideals?

&gt; What I do know though, is that these men are adults and acted from an adult mind, made the decisions they did to do what they have done, 

Well done. You've established the mens rea for murder...So too did the jury and justice was handed down.

We understand that some discussions will require a screenshot from the show. This can be discussion about special effects, cinematography, wardrobe, creature design, and any number of elements that absolutely requires a visual aid to participate in discussion.

However, we try and keep the clutter of needless images to a minimum. If somebody clicks your link believing it to lead to discussion, all they'll find is an image link. There doesn't need to be an image here, so why not simply cut out the middleman and let users get straight to great discussion?

Further, we try and make [our guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/DoctorWho/w/Policies/Content) as easy to access as possible. You can see a link to them right in the sidebar, and I assure you that it's a very light read. 

These rules were created by the community for the community, and they serve to help make /r/DoctorWho a better place to share all things and thoughts Doctor Who. We try and make them as non-intrusive as possible.

This particular rule isn't a very uncommon one. You'll see it crop up in quite a few of the television show subreddits like /r/GameofThrones.

Again: This is a really good post posing a really good topic of discussion. Why not check out our guidelines (you'll only have to read it once) and make a self-post sharing the opinion you have here?

In the league, he's scored 9 goals in 9 games without Suarez, the only one of those goals against a top half team was against United earlier this season, 3 were against a Fulham team that had just successfully avoided relegation only a week or two prior and had nothing to play for, 2 were against a Newcastle team that finished with the 4th worst defense in the league and avoided relegation by 2 points, and another was completely gifted to him by Shelvey at the Liberty earlier this year, he was kept off the score sheet by Everton, QPR and Southampton at Anfield. 

It's no secret why the finest goal scoring period of Sturridge's career is coinciding with a drought from Suarez when, previous to Sturridge's run he was having one of the finest goal scoring periods in premier league history.

""Scotland's public finances are in a healthy position, with the country generating more income than it spends even in a period of recession, official statistics published today show. This is the fourth year in a row that Scotland has generated a current budget surplus, compared to a UK-wide deficit over the same period."" 
http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2010/06/23103654


The Economist magazine article stated that Scotland is not subsidised from Westminster, Scotland performs better than all regions outside the south-east of England and Scotland accounts for 10% of the UK's GDP with just 8.4% of the UK population. Edinburgh gives more to UK than any other city and now contributes more to the UK economy per head of population than London. 


Scotland's finances are also detailed in the yearly Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS). Currently it shows that Scotland pays its way and contributes more to public finances than are spent.

Also if the aim is to encourage cycling in order to get cars off the road, reduce congestion, improve air quality, lower noise pollution, public health benefits and so on the main barrier may be getting people to get on their bikes.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Capital punishment has been proven not to be a deterrent against murder, nor is it financially viable compared with whole life sentences. The burden of proof is far below a safe level for convictions, not to mention there has been too many miscarriages of justice to ever consider such a barbaric punishment.

If conviction rates do not fall, provide me with a source. I'd actually be really interested in this source, as we haven't had capital punishment here since the 1800's, or 1700's, how long ago was it beofore that, that we were issued knifes by the government for personal protection as they were essential? Humanity is danging due to technological advancements. We're entertained by watching TV now, rather than thinking about stabbing our neighbours because they keep dumping their shit out the window, rather than emptying it down the grid like a civilized human being would.

When you talk about capital punishment having far too many miscarriage of justice? These guys were on film doing this, there is NO DOUBT it was these two fucking scum bags who murdered Lee Rigby. Makes me sick even reading 'RIP', as he should still be alive now. 

&gt; No one is disputing that they are scum bags, and it's safe to assume they will not directly benefit society but that does not give a nation the right to murder them. Such a view on imprisoned people is regressive and dangerous.

It absolutely does. 'Regressive and dangerous' are key words which hold no relevance here. They murdered one of our soldiers, men who travel thousands of miles to live in horrendous conditions (compared to back home), to protect us from 'foreign threats', (without me adding another 10paragraphcs there). 

&gt; To advocate killing these two men, a crime in which they now serve life for, opens the flood gates for abuse.

So you believe it cannot be implemented properly, in a just manner? I believe it can be, if we have a more democratic voting system toward such policies (as UKip suggest), which puts forward safeguards for 'undeniable guilt', then we can leave the judge to judge if death is worthy, which in this case, I believe it certainly is. 


&gt; Yet you are happy to see it murder?

I'm happy for my country to murder people who murder other people, yep. I support that and believe in it wholeheartedly, whatever you've said and the points you've made so far have not changed this for me. 

&gt; Only 7% of legislation is from the EU and a lot of UKIP voters forget that HRA, while it subjects the land to EU laws, policy and directives, it can always be repealed ergo Parliament is always sovereign.

You're providing a link from fullfact.org. Does this website have an agenda? Have a look at this quote;

&gt; And with 70% of our laws now made in Brussels, we’re being strangled by red tape.

From http://www.ukiphillingdon.com/?page_id=34 a UKip site? Should you contact UKip about this being wrong if your source is reliable? Because I've never heard of your source, mine is UKip. Are our politicians making up complete stats about the cause they're campaigning for? Or are the EU's claws so deep into our policies now that we've turned a blind eye for too long?

&gt; Justice is blind, and does not seek revenge...perhaps if you love your country so much you can share this value?

More bollocks. I love my country enough to want these two men to be killed. If anybody from my family was murdered I'd want the same. Although being constrained into handing out my justice via law, and rightfully so... as innocent until proven guilty is what I believe in. After a criminal has been found a criminal, and guilty of MURDER, then yes, they deserve to die. 

&gt; There is no morals in premeditated murder, which you advocate and this further shows how out of touch UKIP supporters are. Perhaps you would do better in a country which disregards human life and dignity to pursuit of your (frankly) fascist ideals?

Wait, I'm a fascist, racist? Call me a clown and looney if you want, I'm actually quite a normal person with logical reasoning and just so happen to find UKip the most logical out of all the partys out there. 

&gt; As I understand Somalia pretty much doesn't have a Government, as such no taxes are paid to it. You could always move there? Then your taxes would be safe and not used to enforce policy and law which is in the interest of justice, human rights and upheld moral tradition?

LOL, why would I want to move to Somalia? Somalia is a shit hole compared to the UK. I want a higher standard of living, not a weaker one.

&gt;The **i360** is a planned 183-metre (600 ft) [observation tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation_tower) to be constructed on the seafront of [Brighton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton), near to the [West Pier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Pier).  Plans were submitted in June 2006 and were approved by Brighton and Hove City Council on 11 October 2006 with construction projected to start in 2007. Following delays of around fifteen months the off-site construction of the sections of the tower began in 2008 in the Netherlands. Work on reconstructing the arches beneath and East of the pier to allow the tower construction began in November 2012.

I think she was trying to say that the Iraq War had somehow dented the party in some way and the leadership vote somehow made everything bad go away.

Burned flesh, hundred of thousands of orphans, global terrorism, international insecurity, a destroyed economy for Britain and the end of world peace. Endless tears and fucking misery for millions.

They've seen that last years 3rd kit was the best selling third kit of all time, and they've gone with crazier designs because of that. If they keep simple kits, like you suggest, then whilst they are pleasing to the eye, most people won't buy them (because not everyone is as big a fan as you or I) because they have a kit that looks similar to that already. You can speculate all you want but fact of the matter is the warrior kits ARE selling and what they're doing with the kits isn't by accident. 

And yes I mistyped above, I meant to say what you implied in the second paragraph. Please don't try to be condescending towards me whilst simultaneously ignoring the most basic of economic theory. I'll lay it straight. The demand is greater for shirts when designers make the *worth* buying, not by producing the same simple kits every year but instead by doing something different because lots of people won't buy kits every year. You're making the mistake of thinking *you* are the target market, actually the target market is the whole Liverpool fanbase which spans over the whole world. They have different tastes and generally, WON'T buy a kit every year unless it's different enough to justify or they're a big enough fan to warrant it regardless. You don't have to take my word for it. Look at warrior's sales figures. It works and they're not a bunch of chumps, they know what they're doing. Your theory that ""football fans buy shirts"" is so oversimplified I can't even.. You need to broaden your thinking.

Now it just comes across as you trying to find ways for it to be Bentaleb's fault that our game isn't flowing. I've said this before and I'll say it again, as a midfielder you've got to be responsible for getting on the ball yourself, if you position yourself correctly and have the ability on the ball to control it then you'll get the ball. The problem is that when Paulinho and Capoue get on the ball they don't look like they can perform the basics all that well of controlling the ball, moving forward with it and picking out a pass.

&gt; Paulinho is not very good.
&gt; I like him, and want him to do well, but at the moment he just seems to run about a bit, without really contributing anything. He doesn't have defensive discipline, doesn't seem to know what to do with the ball when he has it, is not a great passer, and is largely woeful at finishing.
&gt; He was one of the purchases I was most excited about this past summer, but he's hugely under-delivered, and I'd argue is one of the main reasons why our midfield has not had any penetration into attacking areas.

**Edit:** Here's a handy timeline from another article.

&gt; 1982: Hyde Park nail bombing kills four members of the Royal Household Cavalry, Roy Bright, Dennis Daly, Simon Tipper and Geoffrey Young on 20 July.
&gt; 
&gt; 1983: On 29 May, John Downey's name is first circulated as being wanted for conspiracy to murder for the Hyde Park bombing.
&gt; 
&gt; 2002: John Downey's name first appears on Sinn Fein's lists of On The Run prisoners.
&gt; 
&gt; 2004: In July, a memo from the On The Run review states that SO13, the anti-terrorist branch of the Metropolitan Police, confirms no extradition would be sought for Downey as the intention was to arrest him if he came into their jurisdiction.
&gt; 
&gt; 2006: In March, Gerry Kelly of Sinn Fein is informed by the Northern Ireland Office that three individuals, including John Downey, do face arrest and questioning.
&gt; 
&gt; 2007: On 13 April, in an exchange of letters between the PSNI and the Metropolitan police, it is confirmed by the Met that John Downey is still wanted.
&gt; 
&gt; 2007: On 22 July, John Downey receives a letter of assurance from Mark Sweeney at the Northern Ireland Office saying he is not wanted by police in Northern Ireland and there is no awareness of interest in him from any other police force in the UK. Nine others receive the same letter, which is written in a standard format.
&gt; 
&gt; 2008: John Downey travels to Canada. Mr Downey first sought reassurance from the Canadian authorities, supported by his letter from the NIO, that he could travel there despite being named by British newspapers in relation to the Hyde Park bombing, a charge he denied.
&gt; 
&gt; 2013: John Downey is arrested on 19 May by Sussex police at Gatwick airport on his way to Greece.
&gt; 
&gt; 2014: On 25 February, Mr Justice Sweeney rules that prosecuting Downey would be an abuse of process and stays his trial for the Hyde Park bombing.


**TL:DR** *I think* the gist is, he was wanted in connection to the bombing, but was send one of these letters mistakenly saying that he wasn't wanted, which means in this instance he got off. There's a lot more complicated stuff as well, such as the wording of the letters suggesting he could be arrested if new evidence came to light, and whether all 180 letters say the same thing etc.

true,Callduron,null,null,"Let's draw out the key selling points of the series:

- feminism. Originally Steed's partner was intended to be a man but they gave Honor Blackman the part without changing the script. So she was taking on a very male part and role in a way not really seen before. Hugely influential, one of the first of the arse-kicking females who have become such a mainstay of TV. People in the 60s tuned in, fascinated to see this amazing woman do what had previously been unthinkable.

- Steed's quaint Englishness. Actually it was old-fashioned even by the standards of the early 60s, a throwback to an idealised Edwardian period of English gentlemen. However I do think it's something that people rather like. I don't think you could tone it down at all and still claim to be an Avengers remake, you couldn't say have a Morse-like character (still old-fashioned, still a gent, just not over the top enough). But is there still a market for such a silly pastiche of a part, almost as bad as a Dick Van Dyke chirpy cockney?

- glamour. The Avengers got lucky with Blackman and Rigg who were amazing (and the one after Rigg was terrible). Also they were ahead of and setting high street fashion. That would be really hard to re-create.

Overall I think it's a hard IP to do justice to. However if they do do it, then it should be cheesy and camp because that's at the heart of it, we don't need another grim spook show with scruffy paracops ""disappearing"" villains in the teeth of a hostile bureacracy.

And if they hadn't fucked with the 1m+ people that turned to electronic cigarettes in the last 5 years, it would have easily led to a double-digit drop in the amount smoked over the next 5 years.

Baby steps though eh.

Cunts.

I've not touched a cigarette in 1 year and 1 month thanks to an electronic cigarette that contains no tar, no carcinogens, no acetone, no cyanide, requires nothing to be burned, creates no waste, and tastes and smell like fucking caramel heaven, which doesn't linger around for days after I use it. I can smell, taste and breathe better and easier than I have in the last 13 years of being a smoker and they put through regulations that help no one but people manufacturing the poor quality, expensive, shitty cig shaped versions that you can buy from petrol stations that last a couple of hours for a serious smoker, penalising a multi-million pound start-up industry that's boomed and made a lot of progress in the UK and giving pharma and actual tobacco companies a BOOST by ensuring their crappy products are easily modifiable to conform with the new directive.

By restricting nicotine concentrations (fine) and restricting the amount you can have in one tank to 2ml? I have a 3ml tank right now I refill at least once a day and I was only a moderate (10 ish a day) smoker when I actually smoked. For people with serious (2+ PAD) addictions who are going to need to start on something like 24mg to feel like it's helping... oh wait no, you can't, because now you can only get 20mg or less.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"You seem to be making a lot of assumptions there. I'm no expert on the topic, but I see no reason why a federal EU would mean a mono-cultural EU. There could be a federal EU with lots of autonomy, which is literally what a federation is. 

&gt; The monarchy would cease to exist for a start

Why? There's no mandate as far as I know with the EU forcing countries to become republics, and I see no reason why the monarchy couldn't act as a subnational one, as happens in some African countries. The Queen wouldn't be monarch of the EU, but could still be monarch of the UK (or that land that was the UK).

&gt; drinking beer by the pint would likely disappear

Again, why? While EU countries may use SI units as 'professional' units (for stuff like business), I see no reason why a more federal EU would ban the use of the word pint, especially in the colloquial sense down the pub.

&gt; We'd compete as team EU in the Olympics

Why not treat it like the football? England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar are separate teams to FIFA, but all part of the UK politically. Australia and other colonies competed in the Olympics despite at the time being part of the British Empire. There is no reason why the countries in the EU couldn't be tied closer politically, yet still retain independence in sports. 

&gt; EU is somewhat anti-democratic

Of course reforms would need to be made, and seeing that a more federal EU would need sweeping reforms in plenty of other areas, I don't see why this is such an issue. A federal EU wouldn't have the same political mechanisms as the current EU. 

&gt; There's also the messy issue of Britain's fourteen remaining colonies, what happens to them? Do the Falklands become an EU mandate?

I assume it would be assessed as it is assessed now, on a case by case basis. [This table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_member_state_territories_and_the_European_Union#Summary) on wikipedia lists territories with special memberships to the EU, which make up a lot of the overseas territories European countries still have. For example, French Guyana is pretty much a full member of the EU. A federal Europe would probably mean greater integration, but as some of the territories on that list show, it doesn't seem too much of a problem.

The inexorable logic of a open market is the unification, homogenization of laws, taxation and monetary policy. Otherwise you don't have an equal or free market and thus you develop the uneven distribution of outcomes across the system.

The idea that any nation is ""self-determining"" is a construct as much as the EU itself is a construct. I recommend you do some reading on the liberal nationalism of post-1848. Bear in mind the ""self-determination"" that you hold dear as a concept only really became entrenched after 1848. Until then the idea of a ""nation"" was a mixed bag of myth and ideology. I recommend reading up on guys like Ernst Gelner. You can also chase up the perenialists such as Herder and his ilk for an opposing view. 

But frankly put your idea of nation has only been around since 1848. That's around 150 years. Whereas other, more fluid ideas of how to organise a political unit have survived much much longer. Even longer than the Westphalian system of states. 

So your division between trade and political ideology is actually a false one. Political ideology creates nation states as much as it creates the EU. It's just that we're used to the idea of the nation-state being the ""right"" and legitimate mode of expression thus we thing that it's somehow different when it's not. 

The problem for us is going to be this. In about 100 years, the biggest nation states are going to dwarf ours. Anyone who knows anything about economics knows that the size of the internal market of these large 500million plus states is going to be a massive element in the global economy. It's also true that the size of the corporation is now reaching the level of nation states. 

That's gong to be the future of our word, and it follows that the people who are part of the 500million club are going to have a lot more power than people who are not in it. 

The EU is going to be 500million people - and it's going to be more developed and economically productive than anything else on earth. It follows that it's going to be a massive international super power.

There's no mandate as far as I know with the EU forcing countries to become republics, and I see no reason why the monarchy couldn't act as a subnational one, as happens in some African countries. The Queen wouldn't be monarch of the EU, but could still be monarch of the UK (or that land that was the UK).

Doesn't a federal EU imply becoming a superstate controlled by a single government? The Monarch would necessarily need to be stripped of their power to declare war and sign bills into law and why call a powerless monarch a monarch? I know the Queen chooses not to use her powers (because we'd abolish the monarchy if she did abuse political power) but they still exist and give legitimacy to the role.

&gt;Again, why? While EU countries may use SI units as 'professional' units (for stuff like business), I see no reason why a more federal EU would ban the use of the word pint, especially in the colloquial sense down the pub.

Right up until 2009 they were trying to outlaw the use of pounds and ounces in trade and convert our roads to km/h and metres. They only stopped because it was making them unpopular over here, that would not be a concern if we were a state of the EU. It would be a safe assumption that as the only state that still uses Imperial measures we would be forced to fully metricate to bring us in line with the rest of Europe.

&gt;Why not treat it like the football? England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar are separate teams to FIFA, but all part of the UK politically. Australia and other colonies competed in the Olympics despite at the time being part of the British Empire. There is no reason why the countries in the EU couldn't be tied closer politically, yet still retain independence in sports. 

I guess that could work.

&gt;I assume it would be assessed as it is assessed now, on a case by case basis. This table on wikipedia lists territories with special memberships to the EU, which make up a lot of the overseas territories European countries still have. For example, French Guyana is pretty much a full member of the EU. A federal Europe would probably mean greater integration, but as some of the territories on that list show, it doesn't seem too much of a problem. 

I've never visited any of the overseas territories but I'm pretty sure the Falklands voted very heavily in favour of *British* rule. If Britain ceased to exist as a sovereign state why would they have any interest in being an EU member? But can a territory of 2,932 people actually attain independence and repel a possible Argentine invasion? It still sounds like a horrible mess to me.

The RTD era did have more real &amp; lasting consequences for the Doctor. Many people were lost, in more ways than one &amp; the Doctor was left to put on a brave face alone. 

Another thing I liked about RTD's era? I liked the way the episodes flowed, as a single or as part of the whole season. You could watch one (if you'd never seen Doctor Who in your life) &amp; enjoy it. Sure you still had head scratching, ""hmmmm I wonder what that meant"" moments but rather than frustrate you it fueled your need to see the other episodes &amp; find out what the deal was....if you did this in SM's era? You'd be fucked &amp; give up before you started.

Lastly, RTD's Doctor....I loved that ""his"" Doctor, 10, wasn't infallible. Yes he was a time lord, knowledgeable, clever, powerful, but he also had human characteristics that, in my opinion, only helped him achieve more greatness. Ten showed great compassion, strength, weakness, arrogance, hilarity &amp; at times cruelty. Ten didn't achieve anything simply because ""he was the doctor &amp; all cower in fear of him"", he had to work for it, applying his experience &amp; knowledge to the test. Sure, he won but not just because he showed up. This scenario had happened a LOT in the SM era with 11, he was the Doctor, so he easily overpowered his enemies just BECAUSE of this fact.

If the power ""drains"" her or makes a piano fall out of the sky onto a random kitten the audience needs to be told that otherwise it's just a failure by the author to understand how the character he created would behave. It's like having Superman wait for a bus.

They were filmed beheading him, they admitted it, they said they were soldiers against the West and would fight and die for a competing civilisation. What possible benefit would there be to keep these men alive? Are they supposed to be rehabilitated so they can go on to become good citizens? Does anybody think there is the remotest possibility of that happening? Keeping them alive is only going to allow them to enable more conversion of prisoners inside to Islamic gangs, which are starting to become more of a problem for prison officers.

Garland Place is basically right behind Abertay University and next to the new Opal 1 / Parker Street halls of residence, it's roughly 12 - 15 minutes walk to Dundee University. I've had friends live on the same street and the properties have always looked nice. 

Basically, I'd be quite happy to live in that property and it works out at £250 each per month. 

I'd recommend Grant Management too, friends had been with them and they seemed equally as good, generally most students seem to rent with them. I think they had a bit of a reputation for less well kept properties but I've not seen that myself.

Who you should avoid though is Jamal Property World, they had an awful reputation (and probably still do), the accommodation offered was really basic as well. Some of the properties they offer now seem nice enough but from everything I had heard about them I'd stay well clear.

Donna was immature and irritating and grew into a mature, enabled, empowered character. Rose was similar, and also grew from something of a low-life to virtually a god. Martha was infatuated with the doctor but learned to live on her own and make her own path. Amy learned to let go of the things she waited for and live her life without the doctor. she also learned that he's not the best thing in the world and there are other people (rory) worth being in love with. 

This is the issue with Clara, she's strong, empowered, flirty but not overly so, and can do virtually anything the doctor needs her to do. I don't know realistically where they can take her character.

&gt;**Deus ex machina** (pronounced [ˈdeus eks ˈmaː.kʰi.na], /ˈdeɪ.əs ɛks ˈmɑːkiːnə/ or /ˈdiːəs ɛks ˈmækɨnə/ ; from [Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language), meaning ""god from the machine""; plural: dei ex machina) is a [plot device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_device) whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability or object. Depending on how it is done, it can be intended to move the story forward when the writer has ""painted themself into a corner"" and sees no other way out, to surprise the audience, to bring the tale to a [happy ending](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_ending), or as a comedic device.

Lending money to give a business an opportunity to grow and making a sensible profit from the risk that it might fail to perform is one thing.  An industry where a fraction of a second advantage in a purchase or sale can make millions is unhinged.

The money that people make from those sort of deals does not come out of nowhere, if you ""win"" a million, someone else just lost out and you've done fuck all to deserve it.  Have you created anything at all?  No, you've just swindled someone out of it.  At least traditional gamblers doesn't act like they earned it.  If a gambler bets and loses their house they lose their house, fine, that's the risk they took but if a big player in our banking industry loses *billions* our government jumps in and pays their debts to the bookie cos they've got us over a barrel and have everyone convinced (probably correctly) that life as we know it will be over if we let them ""lose their house"".

That means that either every version of Clara is the same, with the same flaws and goals, which seems counterintuitive to having multiple versions of her, or as an audience, we are forced to meet a new Clara each time, turning her into something akin to a guest starring character.  I haven't had enough time with a single Clara to really care about her yet.

3)  Early Clara showed so much promise.  Asylum of the Daleks Clara was SO interesting--her twist made her fascinating.  And the prospect of The Doctor travelling with THAT character as his Companion was really engaging for me.  Christmas special Clara was also interesting, and was someone I'd be curious to see interact further with The Doctor.  But by the time we started the regular episodes, she lost the things that made me interested in her.

It feels like instead of creating a new character, they went ""Oh, the audience likes spunky characters!  Let's make a spunky girl!""

&gt;The **Manic Pixie Dream Girl** (**MPDG**) is a [stock character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_character) type in [films](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Films). Film critic [Nathan Rabin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rabin), who coined the term after seeing [Kirsten Dunst](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten_Dunst) in Elizabethtown (2005), describes the MPDG as ""that bubbly, shallow cinematic creature that exists solely in the fevered imaginations of sensitive [writer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter)-[directors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director) to teach broodingly soulful young men to embrace life and its infinite mysteries and adventures"".  MPDGs are said to help their men without pursuing their own happiness, and such characters never grow up; thus, their men never grow up.

He established his credibility as being beyond reproach on the final day of the January 2012 window when he called the signings of Nelsen and Saha hours before the media had gotten a whiff of either deal (though that was not the first info he had shared). 

Since that time he has had a few missteps (notably with Moutinho in summer 2012 and Leandro in January 2013) but for the most part his information is absolutely spot on. Late in the summer 2012 window he hinted at the signings of Dembele and Dempsey via spurscommunity's The Goat. More recently he confirmed that Chelsea were in for Willian when others were saying the deal was done to us, and confirmed the rumors regarding Holtby were true last month, among many other things.

As far as ITKs go JJ is about as reliable as they come. The conventional wisdom for years has been that his source is Sherwood himself, though JJ denies that. As others have mentioned he has a bit of a penchant for drama, and in the summer announced that he would be retiring as an ITK at the end of the window, but has continued to provide snippets of information since.

I believe there are plenty of people for whom Blair's image couldn't really get any worse.  He's one of the all-time greatest cunts in human history.  There wasn't a single day during his entire reign as PM when he put the country before his own greed, ambition and self-righteous smugfuckery.   Someone I genuinely don't think I would piss on if he was on fire.

I'd actually rather have 10 years of Thatcher than that twat (and yes, I'm old enough to remember).  At least she didn't fuck around with pretending she was some likeable woman-of-the-people like that smarmy, bouffant-haired, gurning wanker.

Fuck him.  Fuck his stupid fucking wife.  Fuck every one of the evil, conniving assholes that put him in power.  Fuck Tony Blair.

For me 10 was so very human. He seemed to carry on with McGann's romantic streak and turning it up to 11. He had his brushes with being human and came so close to admitting he loved Rose. There was this permanent undercurrent of sadness to his Doctor that is quite heartbreaking and endearing.  He was such a relatable character, which isn't always the case with the Doctors from what I've experienced.

So many people seem to dislike his final line, but I think it perfectly embodies 10. He had so little time in that body, and he liked who he was and in his final moments he could drop the mask and quietly admit to himself that he didn't want to change.  

Is that really so bad?  He'd had enough of death, enough of dying, enough of loss.  He just wanted to continue to exist. The fact that he died saving an old man is also so very fitting. Wilfred had lived a long full life, it would be right for him to die then but no, there is no way the Doctor would let that happen, so he died to save an old man.  It's so fitting.

Should every Doctor have the same attitude?  Absolutely not, but I think it's important that at least one Doctor, the most human Doctor of all embodies that and that final line, followed by the destruction of the TARDIS seems completely perfect.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; Doesn't a federal EU imply becoming a superstate controlled by a single government? The Monarch would necessarily need to be stripped of their power to declare war and sign bills into law and why call a powerless monarch a monarch? I know the Queen chooses not to use her powers (because we'd abolish the monarchy if she did abuse political power) but they still exist and give legitimacy to the role.

Lots of countries have Monarchs that don't have any powers whatsoever but keep their titles. South Africa has around ten - notably the Zulu King. Malaysia has a few Sultans. They all sit happily within a federal system. You need to explore the rest of the world and the possibilities that exist. 

It's also a bit of null argument. If the Monarch has no de facto power, as in our arrangement, and we would strip the Monarch of that power if they tried to use any power they had - then the argument is a pretty useless one. It's like complaining about someone else moving your chair when you were going to move it anyway. 

&gt;It would be a safe assumption that as the only state that still uses Imperial measures we would be forced to fully metricate to bring us in line with the rest of Europe

I fail to understand why this is a problem. Units of measure are arbitrary. We made them up anyway. We also changed our own currency to decimal. It was accepted. So you'll have to spend a few weeks getting the sense of a new system of measure. 

&gt;If Britain ceased to exist as a sovereign state why would they have any interest in being an EU member? But can a territory of 2,932 people actually attain independence and repel a possible Argentine invasion? 

If they get EU membership as part of their British membership then they get the support of 500 million people and the world's largest economy, as opposed to 70million and economy number 4/5.

Is Argentina really going to want to piss off it's largest and richest export market. I doubt it. 

You seem to under the impression that the EU somehow makes you less masculine and you'll lose levels of testosterone if you accepted that it might actually have some merit.

Here's a thought for you - the US is the world's largest economy and because of this it outspends every other nation combined in military spending. It has such monetary clout that it can fund a trillion dollar war on credit.

Maybe that's part of why I wasn't as much into Tennantdoctor, because he traveled without a main companion for a while.  But as you said, because he was the most human doctor, I guess he didn't need the human contrast as much.

I also think Rodgers needs to evolve the playing style again. We need to be able to grind out results away from home and we don't seem able to at the moment. It's one thing outscoring Swansea at home, it's quite another to do the same to Real Madrid or Bayern Munich.

That said, when the games come round, pessimism will go out of the window and I'll be fully expecting us to give Barca an Arsenal-style shellacking.

&gt;having to wear a helmet over your crafted interview hair

My hair's an easy-to-manage no2 buzzcut, so that would be a non-issue.  When I was going through my hairy-biker phase and had it long I'd use a couple of hair ties to stop it getting knotted and just brush it out.

&gt;getting your interview outfit dirty

Lightweight coat/waterproofs when it's pissing it down and shorts/tshirt that you can put your interview clothes on over when it's not.   Granted that's probably not going to work if you've got a £4000 interview suit.  But if you've spent that sort of money on clothes you've probably still got a car.  

&gt;carrying your bag

Bag rack on the bike?  

&gt;where are you going to safely park the bike?

That depends on the company and location.  If it's in the town centre there's going to be plenty of places to park (as well as public toilets to get changed in if required).  Bigger companies with their own parking will likely have their own bike bays.

Condemning that is like condemning a women's rights group for campaigning for the whole of parliament to be female - of course it's not going to happen, but why shouldn't they be allowed to campaign for it?

 [**First Minister and deputy First Minister**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First%20Minister%20and%20deputy%20First%20Minister): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;The **First Minister** and **deputy First Minister** ([Irish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): Céad-Aire agus leasChéad-Aire,  [Ulster-Scots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Scots_dialects): Heid Männystèr an Heid Männystèr depute or First Meinister an First Meinister depute)   are the joint heads of the [Northern Ireland Executive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Executive), with overall responsibility for the running of the [Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_First_Minister_and_deputy_First_Minister) (OFMDFM).

&gt;The two positions are a [diarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarchy), meaning that they have equal power. Created under the terms of the 1998 [Good Friday Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday_Agreement), both were initially nominated and appointed by members of the [Northern Ireland Assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly) on a joint [ticket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_(election\)) using cross-community ([consociational](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consociationalism)) principles. That process was changed following the 2006 [St Andrews Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews_Agreement), meaning that the First Minister and deputy First Minister are now nominated separately by the largest parties in each of the two largest community designations in the assembly. The incumbents are [Peter Robinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Robinson_(politician\)) of the [Democratic Unionist Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party) as First Minister and [Martin McGuinness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_McGuinness) of [Sinn Féin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinn_F%C3%A9in) as deputy First Minister.

Netflix? I can see House of Cards, modern family, the tudors, orange is the new black, breaking bad etc. all amazing shows and new stuff added all the time.

Most people are aware of the revelations, even if they might be fuzzy on the details.

I'd say the reaction has been muted.

As to why it's been so muted, I can only speculate based on my own opinions.

1) I would think many people have assumed that the internet is insecure for years, and treated it warily anyway, so this doesn't really change anything for them.

2) Again, many people have had their data collected and abused for years by companies such as Google, Facebook etc, so again this doesn't really change anything for them.

3) While it might be possible to stop the NSA and GCHQ, there's no chance of stopping Chinese or Russian agencies, so what's the point?

4) A lot of people fundamentally trust state intelligence services in the UK, more so than in the US. Indeed, to me the most shocking revelation was not that the intelligence services could know everything about me (that's always been the case; the NSA spying makes it *much* easier for them, but they could achieve the same effects via old fashioned methods); but that that information was shared with the US, who then shared it with private contractors.

&gt;I'm pointing out that some people do not ""pay"" for what they use, whereas others ""pay"" more than what they use.

But the 'some people' have a decent reason to be excluded. You haven't listed one for yourself yet.

&gt;I do not pay for a TV license because I do not have to. I use iPlayer occasionally when a show takes my fancy, because the service is available free of charge.

I do not pay for the NHS. But when I need it, I can walk into A&amp;E and get treated for free. You don't see a problem with those two statements? People used to not wear seatbelts because it 'wasn't against the law' - does that make their actions acceptable?

&gt;If we were all judged to be ""sponging fuckheads"" for using services provided by entities that we do not directly pay for then I would not at all be surprised if we're all ""sponging fuckheads"" in some capacity at some point in our lives.

But most wouldn't go on a public forum in order to preserve their illusion that they're doing nothing wrong.

&gt;

&gt;**Kemp Town railway station**, sometimes referred to as **Kemptown railway station**, was a terminus station in [Kemptown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemptown,_Brighton), [Brighton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton) (now part of the city of [Brighton and Hove](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_and_Hove)), [East Sussex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Sussex), [England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), on a (now closed) branch line which terminated at Kemp Town station. This line branched off the [East Coastway Line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coastway_Line) a short distance from the Ditchling Road tunnel, between [London Road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Road_(Brighton\)_railway_station) and [Moulsecoomb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulsecoomb_railway_station) stations. The [branch line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_line) and all its stations are no longer extant.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt; this is a gap left open explicitly, there's been no moves to close it. Why?

I would imagine because they don't really want to put a paywall up in front of the web services - and if everyone is paying the license anyway, it doesn't matter. Which is not too different from cheating your train fare because there are no guards around and asserting that everyone else pays, so why does it matter?

&gt;Over 400,000 housholds don't pay the licence fee (~1 in 60 households) 

By deliberate avoidance or because they're invalid/ old/ etc.? There's a big difference between the two.

&gt;I don't even know what you mean by that second sentence, there's no actual point there.

It means an excuse you create for yourself will not automatically be accepted by everyone else.

&gt;They don't care for people using only their online services (nor in fact their radio services which are paid for by the licence fee but no one needs to pay it to listen to the radio)

Sure, and if the train companies were that bothered about people skipping their fare, they're have more ticket checkers, so you're not doing anything morally wrong....so far, that's the sum of your justification - if they wanted money, they'd make sure you had to pay it.

&gt;And just saying excuse isn't an argument

You haven't created an argument yet, just given your personal justification as to why £12 a month to pay for a service for everyone is beyond you.

&gt;provide me with 1 example of a tax that you don't have to pay, yet people choose to pay and I'll concede that point.

So you're not expected to pay to watch TV? You're going to pretend that the other 'free' services are provided because it's a reasonable assumption that you will be watching TV on at least a semi-regular basis?

&gt;I don't have to pay, so I don't

With a blatantly shallow excuse as to why.

&gt;if you think people spending their money on other things, given the choice to do so, is somehow immoral, that's your problem not mine.

Actually you're making it everyone's problem by reducing the quality of service and programming you get due to the total fund for the BBC being reduced. And then pretending it's not your responsibility for that happening.

A paywall would be stupid - Sky are only able to make it work by greatly reducing the utility of Sky Go by reducing the amount of devices than can be registered and cutting down the amount of simultaneous streams in a way that would impact iPlayer's usefulness very significantly.

While the path is segregated, I'm sure many pedestrians will wander into the cycle path, just as they do on clearly marked, orange-tarmac paths. Although it does look like the pavement will be raised, so pedestrians should be aware they are stepping into a road/path. Most bikes are going to be travelling at around 15mph I'd estimate, but someone who is belting along in top gear can be going upwards of 30mph. That's acceptable on a road, but could be dangerous on a shared path. Really, as cyclists we need to show judgement and ride in a sensible manner, which shows that we aren't all red light-jumping idiots. However, there will always be a selfish few people in any group who feel that the rules don't apply to them and they can ride however fast or dangerously as they like.

Likewise, pedestrians need to be aware that on a cycle path, cyclists are travelling at a higher speed than them and need to show a certain awareness, rather than just ambling about all over the place!

I'm really hopeful that this is the start of a more serious effort to make Bristol a more cycling-friendly city, as what was done a few years ago when we were actually a cycling city, was pretty mediocre and hardly revolutionary.

true,GetKenny,eng-sussex,South Saxon,"&gt;To grow up in England is really to only get one side of the debate given to you on the issues of self-rule for the other countries of the UK. It’s to be told that all of the UK (including the rest of England) is subsidized by London. It’s to have any alternative voices, such as Alex Salmond, become figures for ridicule and lampoon. More than either of those, it’s to be presented with the emotive ideas that countries who want to break away and manage their own affairs are somehow motivated by a love for historic battles and hate everything English.

Who's ignorant here?

Most people I know, whilst hoping Scotland will stay in the Union, can quite understand why some  Scots want an independent nation with a more relevant government, and we are hoping that, in the case of a yes vote the divorce arrangements are equitable to both sides, so we can continue living side by side on good, or maybe even better terms.

They might be interesting but they don't result in tangible real world value for others in the same way as engineering does.

For example, if you ""cheated"" on your entire degree and literally knew nothing about your subject but got the full accredited qualification. its unlikely this knowledge gap would be disastrous to your career.

the same is not true of medicine or maths or physics, if you did the same.

I remember as an undergraduate having 6 hours of labs on a Friday and a lecture to follow, while drama etc actually played games and had very few lectures or workshops a week and seemed to be having a much easier time.

Well the result of that is that the knowledge and skills you learn in ""fun time"" are less sought after and less rewarded in the real world as money is linked to industrial relevance, and all the fields that are related to the arts that do make serious money don't actually require formal qualification in order to do so.

If you have an easier life at university for choosing a soft subject that you find ""fun"" you cant really be surprised that no one values your knowledge or skills when applied to the real world.

No they don't (well, I don't think so - it's hard to know asthese sentences don't make any sense). The statistic that only a tiny minority have an internet connection but don't already pay a licence fee is easy to work out by looking at the number of households who don't pay a licence fee, which is tiny.

Correct.

You must be so proud.

Spoken like a true poll-tax rioter.

&gt;If the entirety of the BBC went subscription only today- no iplayer, no website, no radio- I'd just drop it with a shrug and never look back.

But until then, you'll just let all the license-payers provide your free service.

&gt;Because it's not a tax and it's hideously bad value compared to it's competitors.

Laughable statement, which ignores so many aspects it's quite apparent this is a justification to yourself and little more.

You do realise that the second time you've repeated the same statement in the same post, right?

&gt; Like the two different streaming services I pay for and it cost me less than the TV license combined because they are value for money.

Because it's all you-you-you, and in no way meant to provide stuff for everyone. Try looking further than yourself.

&gt;They are. Not everyone is bothered by ads. What was it again? 

Because nobody runs ad-block in any way at all.

&gt;It's not just for you. Your feelings on what you actually watch and how you watch it are irreverent because it's for everyone.

So acknowledging that everyone paying for a service meaning a) more content so you can (whisper it) choose what suits you and b) less cost is simply beyond you?

Personally, I think that's fair enough. If you're watching content the BBC paid to produce, you should be paying to do so. But the flip side is that if you're *not* watching content the BBC paid to produce, or if you're watching it through some means that has been paid for (such as another TV channel that paid to use BBC content) you shouldn't have to pay.

I don't have a TV and don't have a TV license. I also don't use iPlayer. I've thought for a while that if lot's of people used iPlayer without using a license, that was really just creating a convenient excuse for the next ramp up in TV license regulations.

Of course the 500,000 could be bullshit - the BBC and the TV License Authority have a proven record of assuming that everyone not watching TV must be doing something wrong. [The total number of TV licenses in force in 2009/10 was nearly 25 million](http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-licences-facts-and-figures-AB18/), and [there were 26.3 million households in the UK in 2011](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/family-demography/families-and-households/2011/stb-families-households.html), so the 500,000 figure assumes that between a third and a half of all households that don't have a license must be using iPlayer.

That just doesn't happen in other disciplines, it shows far too easily if you kept failing weekly medical exams, but in Arts you really can coast for 3 years and still come out with a degree.  

The other issue with the arts is that a lot of emplyers do not recognise the huge difference in arts graduates with 2.2s, 2.1s and even 1sts.  This links to the above, and is a failing in employers for not recognising the difference in quality.  Alongside this, you have the issue of employers not placing enough emphasis on *where* an arts graduate obtained their degree - a History graduate from Oxford with a 2.1 will be a far more impressive Historian than a History graduate with a 1st from Oxford Brookes.  The Oford graduate will have written at a higher level and will have covered far more in their undergraduate course.  The expectations, and what is taught at universities on arts courses is so uneven that it makes confidently identifying the best from the pool of graduates is so hard.

We would have to agree to disagree on that. As our activity has only been growing and growing (even faster now with the mtgox debacle), comparatively small when a few of months of growth is reflected to half a year or a few years (of other Exchanges), but exponential growth is exponential, and I for one am definitely keeping close tabs.

We're not a broker or a vendor, we're an Exchange. To be a broker or a vendor is a completely different business model.

We don't aim to imitate the other already (good) working models for the UK, we aim to supplement them for the good of the people.

&gt;It's chicken and egg.

The chicken came first, because of evolution. In the same way, the Exchange comes first, pretty much because of the evolution of supply/demand and the necessity of need. MtGox, BitStamp, Kraken, etc, all started with a small amount of customers. 

Businesses like these take time to grow and develop, expecting large amounts of trade within the 1st month, or 2nd, or 3rd would be mistaken, also, seed funding definitely helps. A lot of exchanges had seed funding which imitates initial growth, when in fact they only have a few traders and don't have a lot of active traders for many months after launch.

There are currently [about 40](http://www.napf.co.uk/PressCentre/NAPFbuzz/0250_New_report_on_cross_border_pension_schemes.aspx) cross-border pension schemes between UK/Ireland or Ireland/UK - so the idea is not unprecedented.

Generally, UK pension schemes are about [94% funded](http://www.jltgroup.com/content/UK/employee_benefits/press_releases/JLT_PCS_-_Funding_Update_-_31_July_2013.pdf) (up from 87% last year).

you should experience/suffer American TV, twenty minutes of commercials per hour, five advert slots probably.

night time either the channels shut down, apart from a few, half the rest put up wall to wall infomercial programming, 30 minute paid low production cost commercials for assorted scam products and other stuff like gym equipment and money/health products.

daytime/evening the commercials sell food products, cars, and 100s of medicinal products, lots and lots of medical products, and the pharmaceutical advertising, pushing the latest miracle drug to the masses to convince them to ask their doctor give it to them (the long list of possible side effects at the end of the commercials is jaw dropping), then there's the lawsuit commercials, class action lawsuits against previous wonder drugs that had too many side effects.

and of course theres no 'legal decent honest and truthful' ethic going on in American TV commercials, or TV itself for that matter...

American TV is a wild west. very slick and polished for the most part, trouble is the lack of ethics and the money grubbing, money trumps everything here on TV.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;I wouldn't repeat myself if your arguments didn't all boil down to you being angry that I'm not paying for something that I don't have to and barely use 

You can repeat that you don't use it, but when you then insist that you're only using stuff that's free, it becomes a bit disingenuous.

&gt;It's demonstrably not value for money.

Based on what you alone use. That's not a justification.

&gt; The equivalents are either free or cheaper

Do list the free, no-ads and no-tie ins children's channels that Sky or anyone else offers. That's just one example - refusing to acknowledge any other services simply because you don't use them is ignoring the point.

&gt;to the point where you can pay for them all for nothing if you don't mind adverts or half the price if you do

And still get adverts, tie-ins and so on. 

&gt;This whole thing started because you said it was astonishingly good value.

It is, and it's laughable to suggest otherwise; you're just ignoring the parts that don't fit your personal viewing habits.

&gt;You then tried to change it into ""the greater good"".

No, I didn't. It's always been about the greater good, which is why I assume you're avoiding the issue.

&gt;You have no argument on price

You have no argument on content, meaning that highlighting the price is again, disingenuous.

&gt;And for the last time- it is not a hospital. It is a TV. They are not comparable. 

Yes they are, considering they're both used to provide stuff for everyone at a lower cost. Easily and obviously. It just blows away your 'I don't use all of this, so I won't pay for it' argument. Maybe you should repeat the same unsound justification 'for the last time'.....my six year old can argue better than this.

&gt;I am done here.

Goodo, it is tiring when someone sticks to the same justification and ignores anything that might interfere with that.

&gt;You wanna reply then go ahead, but you might as well shout at your wall.

This isn't just for your benefit. That's why it's called a 'public board' - if anyone else has given the subject as little consideration as you have, this will serve to remind them that their excuses remain just that.

&gt;I feel at this point everyone would get more out of it if you did.

Because you, of course, represent 'everyone', right? :-)

Weather is what is going on outside right now.

With the US having built it's cities a good 1800 years after the first decent sized towns were made in Britain, you guys have benefited from realising that if you copy British towns and villages you end up with like no room.

I think it's interesting though for example that in the UK you tend to just walk down the pavement on whatever side, or up and down the stairs on any side or queue for something and it all works out. 

Clearly in the OP's example there were very few people on the street, but consider this:

1) There is a well traversed high street, think a lot of the streets in London at rush hour. Do people tend to walk in one direction on one side and the opposite direction on the other? Yes.

2) If there are a lot of people walking up and down the stairs, does everyone stick to one side for one direction and the opposite side for the other? Yes. 

3) If there is something to queue for, do people form an orderly queue? (Generally) Yes

Same thing goes for roundabouts, they are there because the natural flow of traffic dictates how often people from each turning pull out onto the roundabout.

Moral of the story: If you got the Internet to back it up, do try Bloodzeed. Start it 15 mins before the game at least since it can buffer for a long time.

Also a quick run-down on your options:


* Flash. Usually somewhat solid and somewhat quality. Isn't too bad if it's the only thing you can find. Usually loaded with pop-ups and ads, tho. No installs needed, you usually got Flash in your browser.

* Sopcast. Better quality than Flash, recommended if you get it to work. I hear Sopcast nowadays is trying really hard to shut down sports streams, so a stream may not last very long if you tune in. Needs installed software to work.

* StreamTorrent. It works. I prefer it over Flash and Sopcastsince it's usually better quality. Requires software installed.

* AceStream. My personal favorite at the moment, the only downside is the slow loading times. Requires software installed.

Also worthwhile to note is that Flash streams are most likely more in phase with the game (but this can differ several minutes between different streams), while AceStream may be 1-5 minutes behind, so reddit and Twitter would be 5 minutes ahead of you in worst case, so that's the price you pay for quality. I prefer to be able to recognize a player from his face and number as well as how he handles the ball, not just how he handles the ball (Flash quality), so I choose quality and keep off reddit and Twitter.

We had a streamer here at /r/COYS not so long ago, haven't seen from him lately tho. He had a Flash stream that was very high quality, so check it out if he returns.",0,1393508016,null,0,false,0,cfq126d,t3_1yxpmi,t1_cfq126d,t3_1yxpmi,null,1432582628,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,eastlondonmandem,english,INGERLAND,"&gt;In fact, by saying that people should not express their faith in public, you are expressing a belief.

Yes except it's in response to a direct question which you asked me. I don't think keeping your personal beliefs around god to your self the same as keeping your opinions to yourself. There can be a line drawn, the same way that most people keep their sex lives to themselves. We don't really need to know what you get up to in the bedroom the same way that it's really irrelevant whether you personally believe in god or not unless you are on a mission to spread the word, in which case you can fuck off just like the atheists nutters that go round spouting their hatred of religion.

&gt;The public space must be kept free for people to express beliefs, opinions and ideas.

There is always a time and place for you to express your beliefs, if you are going to do so publicly then you must accept that others might want to believe you are a twat. Unfortunately it's a double edged sword.

I would agree with the sentiment that yes we should help people but if that's the case what have we been doing for the past 30 years? Why did we step into Afghanistan and Iraq? Because we concocted a reason to do so. What about North Korea? We can't just pick and choose where to step into. What about all the people dying of starvation in Africa and so forth?

If it were really about helping people then Syria would just be a tiny proportion of our aid, but it's really not. It's more about fucking around with world politics for our own gain.

if you dont know them then you could ask the bride if there is anyone local with a good sized house they wouldnt mind introducing you to.
just a thought

airport wise flying into gatwick may be cheeper but torquay would be closer (but thats a much smaller airport so flightly may be more).

cheep travel would be something like coach - national Express is quite good or megabus 

the other option would be to drive i suppose and get a ferry or eurotunnel across, but thats going to cost in fuel...

hope these ideas help

true,JoelDalais,,IBWT (Digital Currency Exchange),"&gt;Your order book with less than 3 bitcoin available for purchase was the metric I used to judge the adoption.

Where as I did previously state we are experiencing growth (though small). I should note that interestingly enough the 'drop off' (for those that know analytics) for the trade windows (B&gt;£) is one of the more significant (50%'ish this month, it was 70% last month and 85%'ish the month before).

So you are quite right in pointing out that the low volume on the trade windows unfortunately puts of potential traders (part of the reason I suspect other Exchanges don't let you see the trade windows until you've registered and gone through xxx processes).

We're definitely keeping it open and view-able to all un-registered and registered customers alike.

&gt;I won't send you coins or money unless its for a reason. I that reason is to exchange one for the other and then get out, your exchange is currently unsuitable. What other reasons would I have for using your exchange?

Very understandable, most customers are the same, day traders are the minority. And then there are those that use us as a 'wallet provider' (because of our security and no need to dl'ing the blockchain, I assume).

We're developing other incentives, working on one right now, but we can't reveal it until its closer to launch (another 2 weeks or so). And a merchant interface after that, custom ATM's still being developed/built, and further developments which I can't mention yet.

Personally, I am of the similar mind as you, I tend to only use an Exchange when I'm buying/selling then moving on. Though I do keep some in an Exchange (IBWT and a couple of others) for the purposes of 'small change' and purchases when needed.

Compared to other exchanges, we offer lower commission (depending upon the exchange), no exchange rates, no transfer fees (depending upon your deposit/withdrawal, there are Royal Mail fees, which work out cheaper). Less to zero verification (depending upon what you're using us for, day trading, selling/buying, wallet provider, etc). And hopefully a better interactive, and more personal customer service. And a local (UK) Exchange, rather than somewhere in Japan, Poland, Slovenia, etc, and we're very open about who we are.

And yes, our Chicken is hungry.

&gt; You will have a very difficult hard life, if you cant accept the reality that industrial markets pay what they need to pay in order to facilitate business, and not what you think you are worth.

As with almost everything in life balance is the key. Its no use having *only* humanities graduates or *only* science/technology graduates. A mix of both is what is needed. If everyone became qualified in one of the scientific fields then you'd simply have a similar problem to now with lots of qualified people and not enough jobs.

The humanities are useful for a range of things, including the ability to think critically and analyse a problem that may not have a right or wrong answer. I use this ability every day in my job (shock horror, someone employed me!) in which I have to deal with lots of people making lots of demands. 

I didn't go to university and study History for the sole purpose of getting a job, I did it because I enjoy history and recognised that the critical thinking I would learn is a very useful tool to have in the job market, despite not having a 'critical thinking' qualification. I am also very aware of my place in the world - I am owed nothing and have been incredibly lucky not only to get a job, but in my life in general.  

Here you say:

&gt; The humanities operate in a fuzzy world with disputed and often times unsupported claims and ideas that don't result in real world tangible benefits obvious to all
&gt; 

I think this applies heavily to scientific fields too. People say exactly this kind of thing all the time about the experiments at CERN or the JET project looking at fusion nuclear reactions.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"D3 is very, very different from release now.  This patch is like a lite version of the expansion.  The new act and class aren't available, but they're rolled out a ton of the gameplay changes.  The AH is going away completely with the expansion pack too, finally.  I absolutely hated the pay2win feel of the AH in D3, it really got away from the whole appeal of the game for me and it's why I quit.  They had to completely neuter drop rates to keep the AH economy in tact, so it was nearly impossible to find item upgrades.  Now they're completely re-vamped the loot system so that legendaries have really cool unique effects, ""smart drop"" tailors most drops to suit your class, rares and legendaries drop way more often (I've only played for 2 hours on the new patch and already found 2 legendaries that are both direct upgrades on my 200K DPS DH), they've changes the skills/abilities drastically to create tons of variation in builds across all the classes, and items now freuqently drop with things that make certain skills for your class better or do more damage which makes it really easy to pick up a new item and then try a new build just because you have a buff to one of the skills.

Combat is a little slower and there's less mob density, which people complain about.  But my impression on it is this: mobs are harder to kill now, you don't just stand still and lifesteal until they all die, you have to actually play the game.  Plus the elite pack density is still quite fine and that's where the $$$ comes from.  And with drop rates being so much more improved maybe your clear times are slower, but the rate at which you find legendaries is still similar if not better (I don't have exact numbers so this might not be exactly true) so in spite of not clearing an area as fast, you're actually finding more stuff.  Basically, they removed the trash farming. And with the smart drop system plus new roll ranges on item stats you're much more likely to find things that upgrade your kit (to a point of course, but there's always going to be a ceiling for that).  I found boots and shoulders in 2 hours yesterday and both were clear upgrades on my existing gear.

Titanfall is sooooo sick!  I don't know much about the single player as it wasn't in the beta at all but for the multiplayer it's a fast paced fairly twitchy FPS that combines normal ground and pound soldier combat with mech fighting.  They've really balanced the normal guys and mechs well and while it's got a lot of reaction based stuff and twitch style gameplay, there's lots of strategy in winning.  You can't really just camp areas because they've built in natural ways to move combat around the map and spawn points change regularly based on that.  I'm really bad at FPS games normally but I've had no problems doing well in this one.

The balance as set by industry in the free market rewards STEM fields more highly because that is the requirement of the market, yes if everyone had a STEM field and nobody had a humanities degree, the humanities market could command a much larger salary. but that hasn't happened and the that is assuming that a STEM field degree is as easy or as difficult to obtain as a humanities degree (something i disagree with) more people struggle and have difficulty with STEM subjects than non stem subjects because they are much more unforgiving and very demanding. 

&gt;I think this applies heavily to scientific fields too. People say exactly this kind of thing all the time about the experiments at CERN or the JET project looking at fusion nuclear reactions

I believe it was Hitler who said something similar about Laser's ""what's the use"", but nobody is in any doubt whatsoever that the effectiveness and usage of scientific discover in that field has benefited us all.

The point is we can clearly point to the application of scientific advancement and engineering for enriching our lives as the products and innovations are clear cut and numerous the same is not true of historians.

Or put more simply would you rather live in a society with no science or engineering what so ever, or one with no history or humanities studies what so ever.

Its incredibly easy to see how terrible a world without engineering and technology would be, its not easy to see how a world without historians or sociologists or academic artists would be.

there is more value to society over a working bridge and a vaccine than there is to a particular interpretation of past events.

This is all ignoring the obvious flaw in a subject such as history in which there is a disputed consensus. No one realistically disputes the laws of physics, but there is contention between causes and effects of historical events by historians etc.

We cannot with great certainty declare the exact cause and effect of significant historical events today, let alone the past.

The UK's rebate is based on a 2/3rds refund of the difference contributed to certain programmes (I think this would qualify) and what it recieves. As the UK is not increasing its payments to those programmes, and the payments back would increase, the net difference would shrink. The net difference shrinking would decrease the size of the rebate and amount to the UK funding its share over and above its net contributions. That's fair enough but you can see how it's not necessarily out of spite towards the EU but out of an evaluation of the costs.

It's a decision on whether the UK government can better spend the money straight away or whether the EU is better able to spend the money. Either way, it is not free for the UK. Also, how far can that £3m actually go?

I know you may think some thoughtcrimes are bad, things like: not accepting everyone, judging another culture to be inferior, or, shock horror, *racism*, but a lot of these beliefs are typically maladaptive. They don't help you. They may be fashionable and held by the majority right now, but that doesn't mean they're any good.

Please provide a single example where intolerance is a good idea? As Nazi Germany under Hitler, Fascism in Italy, homophobic murders in Russia, the genocide in Rwanda and the slave trade years are all born from intolerance. Nice of you to try and attach a passive liberal lable onto me, although your slippery slope logic fallacy doesn't help you. 

Tolerance is as evey bit important to a nations survival than aggression. These two men represent what's wrong with Islam, we should work with the religion to safeguard citizens, not throw our beliefs out of the window and reinstate capital punishment.

Unlike yourself, I see the benefits in both science *and* humanities. Why can't we have both?

&gt; Its incredibly easy to see how terrible a world without engineering and technology would be, its not easy to see how a world without historians or sociologists or academic artists would be.

I would contend that it would be a pretty terrible world in which we had lots of technology but no ethics, or understanding of society, morality and the past. 

&gt; assuming that a STEM field degree is as easy or as difficult to obtain as a humanities degree (something i disagree with) more people struggle and have difficulty with STEM subjects than non stem subjects because they are much more unforgiving and very demanding.

Since you love the sciences, I assume you have some evidence to back up this claim. It seems to me you have based this on the fact that you *personally* think a science degree is harder, which as any scientist knows, is a terrible thing to base your theories on.

&gt; This is all ignoring the obvious flaw in a subject such as history in which there is a disputed consensus. No one realistically disputes the laws of physics, but there is contention between causes and effects of historical events by historians etc.

Again, this occurs all the time in science! Science is a constantly evolving subject depending on the evidence. There can be less certainty within history but evidence and scientific rigour is most certainly used to try to ascertain the truth about the past.

I was hoping you would try that argument. as it shows you don't understand the concept.

Seems you cant tell the difference between citing Hitler as a historical reference point that you would know, and Using Hitler as some kind of inference that if you believe X you are a morally bankrupt madman.

Hitler did actually refute laser technology and the branch of science as unnecessay and of no value, he believed science should concentrate on making tanks faster and more powerful etc. as have other people but it doesn't take a genius to understand why one would reference Hitler above Joe Bloggs for the purposes of a conversation with a stranger. If Winston Churchhill had said it i would have used his name instead.

true,verymuchn0,lfc68,,"I recently broke my ankle and I've been CRUSHING xbox games (because I'm a grad student with a job offer lined up after graduation and cannot go out and drink on weekends or weeknights for that matter).  

I went through:

Assassin's Creed IV (Pirate simulator) - Good but gets really repetitive pretty quickly.  I tried to crush this game in the span of a few days.  Lost interest really quickly but have gone back to it every now and then because it is pretty fun...in small doses.

Borderlands 2 - Really fun, definitely play with friends or at least online.  

Diablo 3 (DIII) - It's hard to be objective about this because I really liked DII back in the day and there was SO much hype around this one.  It's probably really good but because my expectations were so high, I was a little disappointed.  And maybe its because I have it for xbox, I'm sure the PC experience is a little better.  

Bioshock Infinite - Also really good, enjoyed the story.  Not much replay value though.  99 mode is fucking hard.

FF13 &amp; FF13-2 - oh god, do not get these.  DO NOT.  I had an aneurysm and bought both and developed anger management issues due to the shitty characters that make me want to stab an infant and the bullshit story that is unnecessarily convoluted and the general lack of effort in designing map levels.  FF13-2 is slightly better than FF13.  

Tombraider (9? Survivor or whatever) - A lot of fun, little replay value though.  Decent story, enjoyed character development/background.  Brutal death cut-scenes.  It made me feel really bad for Laura whenever I fucked up and caused her to die :(  [This one was by far, the worst.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGpXr87i6_s)

Dragon Age II - just got it yesterday.  Pretty fun so far.  Player controlled combat is kind of like a mix of DIII and WoW.  The combat seems a little too fast and hectic, maybe I'm not used to it yet but I really like the DIII/WoW combat style.  There's SO much to do in terms of quests and stuff.  

Open to recommendations for what to get next.  I'm thinking maybe Farcry 3 or Mass Effect (1, 2 or 3?) but am afraid it will be too similar to tombraider/assassin's creed/borderlands.

I'd actually be really interested in this source, as we haven't had capital punishment here since the 1800's, or 1700's, how long ago was it beofore that, that we were issued knifes by the government for personal protection as they were essential? Humanity is danging due to technological advancements. We're entertained by watching TV now, rather than thinking about stabbing our neighbours because they keep dumping their shit out the window, rather than emptying it down the grid like a civilized human being would.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9411649/Graphic-how-the-murder-rate-has-fallen.html 

This extract shows that crime has fallen, and murder is at the lowest since 1983. Capital Punishment was abolished in 1965 and if you look at the graph on homocide you'll see a continuous increase in the rate from 1960, initially you would say it's due to abolishing capital punishment, but it's fallen without it, and to record lows.


&gt;When you talk about capital punishment having far too many miscarriage of justice? These guys were on film doing this, there is NO DOUBT it was these two fucking scum bags who murdered Lee Rigby. Makes me sick even reading 'RIP', as he should still be alive now. 

I guess you're not sure on how the law works? Firstly you must understand the law is general. It's applied to everyone the same. While it's convenient this murder was captured on CCTV and filmed by the public, not ever murder will as such it's hardly a firm basis to reinteoduce it.

&gt;It absolutely does. 'Regressive and dangerous' are key words which hold no relevance here. They murdered one of our soldiers, men who travel thousands of miles to live in horrendous conditions (compared to back home), to protect us from 'foreign threats', (without me adding another 10paragraphcs there). 

No, they hold more than enough weight. No one disputes the crime they committed was disgusting, but I don't see the Rigby family baying for their blood, only you. The family wanted justice, and they got it. You just want to murder two people, right?

&gt;So you believe it cannot be implemented properly, in a just manner? 

No, it can't - As I said the law is applied generally and exceptions, under any circumstances undermines the legal system entirely. 

&gt;I believe it can be, if we have a more democratic voting system

We have a democratic system, the problem is people do not get involved in the system hence it goes sour.


&gt; which puts forward safeguards for 'undeniable guilt', then we can leave the judge to judge if death is worthy, which in this case, I believe it certainly is. 

Care to expand on 'undeniable guilt' Also anyone who puts death and worthy in the same sentence ought to consider his position.

&gt;&gt; Yet you are happy to see it murder?

&gt;I'm happy for my country to murder people who murder other people, yep. I support that and believe in it wholeheartedly, whatever you've said and the points you've made so far have not changed this for me. 

You are entitled to that view. I simply disagree and will continue to do so.

&gt;&gt; Only 7% of legislation is from the EU and a lot of UKIP voters forget that HRA, while it subjects the land to EU laws, policy and directives, it can always be repealed ergo Parliament is always sovereign.

&gt;You're providing a link from fullfact.org. Does this website have an agenda? Have a look at this quote;

&gt;&gt; And with 70% of our laws now made in Brussels, we’re being strangled by red tape.

&gt;From http://www.ukiphillingdon.com/?page_id=34 a UKip site? Should you contact UKip about this being wrong if your source is reliable? Because I've never heard of your source, mine is UKip. Are our politicians making up complete stats about the cause they're campaigning for? Or are the EU's claws so deep into our policies now that we've turned a blind eye for too long?

UKIP tend to exaggerate quotes, such as 36 million Romania and Bulgarian immigrants - it's hard to retain credibility.

&gt;&gt; Justice is blind, and does not seek revenge...perhaps if you love your country so much you can share this value?

&gt;More bollocks. I love my country enough to want these two men to be killed. If anybody from my family was murdered I'd want the same. Although being constrained into handing out my justice via law, and rightfully so... as innocent until proven guilty is what I believe in. After a criminal has been found a criminal, and guilty of MURDER, then yes, they deserve to die. 

I love my country too. I see murder to be as abhorrent as you, yet allowing the state to murder is asking for abuse of power, as well as being immoral and hypocritical.

&gt;Wait, I'm a fascist, racist? Call me a clown and looney if you want, I'm actually quite a normal person with logical reasoning and just so happen to find UKip the most logical out of all the partys out there. 

You are presenting facist and racist views though, whether you like being called up on it, or not, is irrelevant. I'm not going tit for tat and object to you being normal however UKIP isnt the most logical of the parties, and your logic reasoning is poor.

&gt;&gt; As I understand Somalia pretty much doesn't have a Government, as such no taxes are paid to it. You could always move there? Then your taxes would be safe and not used to enforce policy and law which is in the interest of justice, human rights and upheld moral tradition?

&gt;LOL, why would I want to move to Somalia?
 Somalia is a shit hole compared to the UK. I want a higher standard of living, not a weaker one. 

Because your views are more suited for such a place.

This will come at the expense of league games, but short of a complete disaster, 5th place is where we're ending up. 

Setting our sights on CL at the beginning of the season was lofty, what with City, United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Chelsea and us fighting for four spots. A third of those teams weren't making CL and if you look at the class of the teams (managers included), the two worst are the ones who are not making it. Sucks, but this year its just the truth.

Winning Europa, however, is not only something worth winning, but also something within reach. This is blasphemy to some, but we should perhaps aim for what we can achieve rather than delude ourselves with impossible dreams.

We have to remember that the Scottish Parliament is a 'creature of statute'. It exists, currently, only because Westminster created an act establishing it. Thus it would only take a repeal of this act, to dissolve the Scottish Parliament. 

Scotland wants to control itself, and England comes off, in a legal sense, as a clingy, overprotective mother. I don't think anyone can argue with the idea of Scotland controlling itself if a Yes vote pulls through. In my opinion, if Scotland's powers had not been taken from it(her?) years ago, and had been allowed to retain them(but also become part of the union) then there would be no drive for independence. The idea of independence springs from the fact that England has (literally) taken powers from Scotland and Scotland wants them back( we have *some* back, through devolution).

Why just like the players that are good? That's pretty sad, I mean one of my favourite players is Stephen Carr and he wasn't anything spectacular, he was just a quality reliable player.

&gt; Thanks for letting me know we aren't Chelsea..while they are in the CL

Why the fuck would we be jealous of a club like Chelsea, they are detestable. Maybe it's our overall aim for champions-league but it's not the most important thing at the club. I have cheering on the players over getting Champions league football in terms of importance. Europa league is fun to watch, whether you think it's important or not and I like supporting my team through it.

&gt; If that's the case...unload everyone and put it into the stadium.

People overstate how important a big stadium is, match day sales don't contribute a huge amount to revenue when compared to TV deals.

&gt; Part of being a supporter is being a realist.

You're not, you're being a sensationalist. Case in points below:

Whyyyy, Glasgow?....), but also (and crucially) has a lot of 'foreign' students. By foreign, I do mean Chinese, Eastern-European, but also English(excuse the use of foreign, but its relevant to the vote). 

Now, I like these people, and I value their academic opinion. However, many of them have a direct conflict of interest with the purpose of the vote. The Asian students for reasons pertaining to the fact that they have a UK visa are unlikely to vote against the union that is allowing them in the country to learn. The English students, though not as anti-Scottish as some may expect, tend to be influenced more by English media than Scottish media. Their views are rose-tinted by the more anti-independence views they read.

As for the turnout, 2500 voters really isn't a lot compared to the student population. The law department alone has around 1000 potential voters, and combined with the medical department, you're looking at around 2000-odd. This means the turnout is the equivalent of 2 departments out of the entire university turning up. What about the business, history, nursing, accountancy, art, music depts, etc? I guess my point is that the result doesn't reflect the opinion of the university as a whole, nor does it reflect the turnout that we can expect for the real referendum as this would be disregarding the fact that a) students can be lazy, b) students can have days off or c) students have been in 9-4 with no breaks and the last thing they want to do that day is vote. I don't know what we can expect, but the mock election was neither a win nor a loss for the SNP or the unionists. It was a very big win publicity-wise for Glasgow University.

TL;DR I really really wanted to like this, but the original decent designs have been watered down beyond all recognition and now it's deadly. Bike riders are supposed to keep to a very narrow lane on the far left of queueing cars - when the lights go green, cyclists have to try and go straight on while a filter lane of motor traffic on their right turns left across their path.

This essentially comes down to ""if you're going to do it, do it right"". Otherwise it's a waste of everyone's money and somebody is probably going to die there sooner or later. 

As cycling has got more popular, politicians are proposing some nice ideas - and then as they're developed in planning offices by people who haven't seen good and bad designs internationally, nightmares like this happen.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"I think for the most part you're right, but I think there's still a lot to be said for Moyes bemoaning poor luck and unfair results game after game when actually they've just been terrible. We had the season under Dalglish where we hit the post a load of times and there were plenty of results and points that could have gone the other way, but Man Utd thoroughly deserve to be where they are in the league right now. I watched the game this week against Olympiakos and it brought a smile to my face watching how thoroughly poor and uninspiring United were.

I agree that Moyes has been given a poisoned chalice to a reasonable extent, and I guess it's not common for managers to come out in public and say ""to be honest, most of the players in my squad are either too old or not very good"", but what would bother me most if I was a United fan would be the almost delirious rhetoric coming from Moyes after every game. He was claiming he still felt they were in the title race when they were at odds of 1/250. He's been claiming that he felt they were unlucky or blaming the referee when they were losing and drawing games that to be honest they didn't deserve to win. It's not very encouraging when he seems to be clutching at any excuse other than how the team are just not very good, because it seems to lack the mentality of ""we know things are bad, we're playing poorly, but we're going to work hard to improve and turn things around"". If he's just waiting for luck to swing his way with a mediocre side then Utd are going to be mid-table for a while. 

I don't think he's a bad manager, and I had a lot of respect for Moyes when he was at Everton (if anything I kind of feel sorry for him right now - I'd be thoroughly miserable going home each night in his position), but he's not helping himself in what he says to the press.

Your article is saying that Al Qaeda has been trying to collect the remnants of Gaddafi's weapons stockpile in the power vacuum that the Libyan civil war created, and that the CIA has been stopping them. It's worried about the future of Assad's chemical weapons following intervention, but these weapons are now in the process of being decommissioned. That hardly seems like ""hell"" to me.

Seems you still don't understand, at what point will the penny drop to you especially as a historian that what Hitler said is more likely to be documented and mentioned to people, how do you think i know such an obscure fact if it wasnt for the fact Hitler was so infamous and what he said so relevant.

Its really telling and disturbing that you seem any mention of Hitler or anything he said  has to be discounted or undermined because of what he did. Especially as a historian i find that very disturbing. a really shockingly exposed bias.

You will notice that nowhere in my comment do i infer or even suggest that believing X means you are like Hitler or that you follow his policies , he just happens to be the best known historical figure who said such things and was so clearly wrong relative to the point we are discussing.

I also find it very disturbing that someone so keen to project himself as learned and the value of a history degree doesn't actually understand what an ad hominem attack is, and uses it completely and utter incorrectly.

All of your tactics represent someone who has lost an argument and is trying to derail it by taking the argument in a completely unrelated direction (Hitler) using a wall of text to make it look like you know what you are talking about when you plainly don't.

If they had created this stuff and hedged themselves using credit derivatives then the banks would be risk free. They wouldn't have crashed, it would have been investors who suffered.

Yes, they were repacking, tranching, and selling off the risk via derivatives to clients. But they weren't forcing it down client's throats.

Before Microsoft, Skype was a P2P application, any Skype client could become a ""supernode"" (kinda a server) and it used strong encryption point to point to make sure supernodes couldn't intercept and read traffic (e.g. text chat, meta data, etc). But this same infrastructure makes it difficult to intercept Skype traffic, as it can go from source to destination without ever touching a Skype-owned server (and now you have to dredge the whole internet looking for Skype packets, and then decrypt them).    

This also made running Skype a LOT cheaper than other competing services as you're essentially getting your clients to run servers for you, and it also scales -- the more popular the service, the more servers you have available to you.    

When Microsoft purchased Skype they immediately began work on changing Skype from a P2P infrastructure to a more typical client-server model. This change substantially increased the cost of running the Skype service and from an outside perspective there are few benefits except perhaps making the client a little simpler (since the supernode code could be stripped). There were rumours at the time of the accusation that the NSA either partly funded the purchase of Skype OR guaranteed income from legal interceptions which would sweeten the deal. These are just rumours however (pinch of salt, etc).

LVG, who everyone here seems convinced is coming to Spurs, has the ability to adapt a lineup to the players he has.

---

&gt;In these novels, the interjection ""fnord"" is given [hypnotic power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotism) over the unenlightened. Under the [Illuminati](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati) program, children in grade school are taught to be unable to consciously see the word ""fnord"". For the rest of their lives, every appearance of the word subconsciously generates a feeling of uneasiness and confusion, and prevents rational consideration of the subject. This results in a perpetual low-grade state of fear in the populace. The government acts on the premise that a fearful populace keeps them in power.

It doesn't matter if it is assumed or not. There's no requirement. People can and are allowed to watch programs put up on the iPlayer without a TV license. Blame the BBC for allowing that.

&gt;

&gt;The **Hillsborough disaster** was an incident that occurred on 15 April 1989 at the [Hillsborough Stadium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_Stadium) in [Sheffield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield), England, during the [FA Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup) semi-final match between [Liverpool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) and [Nottingham Forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.) football clubs. The crush resulted in the deaths of 96 people and injuries to 766 others. The incident has since been blamed primarily on the police, and remains the worst stadium-related disaster in British history, and one of the world's worst football disasters. 

&gt;Football clubs used to contest the semi-final of the FA Cup at a [neutral venue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_venue), and in 1989 Hillsborough was selected by [The Football Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association) (FA). While opposing supporters were segregated in the stadium, Liverpool fans were allocated the Leppings Lane stand, reached by a limited number of turnstiles.  Entry to the ground was slow due to the few decrepit turnstiles available to the Liverpool fans, causing dangerous overcrowding outside the ground before kick-off. In an attempt to ease pressure outside the ground, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield ordered an exit gate to be opened. The opened exit gate led to a tunnel marked ""Standing"", which led directly to the two already overcrowded enclosures (pens). In previous years, the tunnel had been closed off by police when the two central pens were full; however, on this occasion the tunnel was unmanned.

&gt;The ensuing influx of supporters caused crushing, and some fans climbed over side fences or were lifted by fellow supporters onto the stand above to escape the crush. Moments after kick-off, a crush barrier broke, and fans began to fall on top of each other. The game was stopped after six minutes. To carry away the injured, supporters tore down advertising [hoardings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard) to use as stretchers, and emergency services were called to provide assistance. Of the 96 people who died, 14 were admitted to hospital. When the FA Chairman visited the Control Box to find out what had happened, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield told a ""disgraceful lie"",  that the supporters had ""rushed"" the gate.

I agree that only showing them for 30 days is a poor show but perhaps that will change as data storage becomes cheaper. Besides, at least there is always a flood of new content (which extends beyond just TV and goes into radio including the invaluable World Service and cultural services abroad).

Furthermore; did you read the latest paper coming out of Oxford? It was on the front page today. It reveals quite starkly that losing the BBC in its current state would have a huge impact across all broadcasters, culturally impoverishing us all in a way we can't imagine since we're so used to having it around.

I'm not really seeing anything compelling about your argument besides the singular and short sighted objection to paying a small amount of money each year.

true,JayCartwright,lfcflame,,"Not from Liverpool but I'll do my best to help ya out! I'll just provide you with brief answers to give you the information you need.

Anyone feel free to reply and put in a bit more detail.

1) Scouser is just a colloquial term for a person from Liverpool. Think of it like this, all scousers are Englishmen, but not all Englishmen are scousers. It's just a part of the culture to identify as a scouser rather than an Englishman.  

A scouse accent is readily identifiable because of it's highly different nature to most other British accents. It's been said that it sounds more Irish than English. Wikipedia describes it as ""fast, highly accented manner of speech, with a range of rising and falling tones not typical of most of northern England.""

2) Bill shankley and Bob Paisley are arguably the two most important managers in Liverpool history. Shanks pretty much laid all the foundation for what the club is today and Bob Paisley is our winningest manager (and one of the winningest of all time). Paisley worked for Shankley and was a big part of his ""boot room"" culture before taking over as manager down the line.

They're called ""kopites"" because that what the supporters of Liverpool call ourselves and although they were managers, they were so revered and loved for what they did for the club that they are kopites to us.

3) People hate Suarez for a myriad of incidents he has had over the years including but not limited to a handball in the world cup, going to ground a bit easily to earn penalties and fouls and a biting incident last season with Branislav Ivanovic. Basically, the way he plays the game irritates many people.

We love him because he is one of us and is arguably our most talented player ever and other clubs' supporters would love him just the same if he were on their team.

4) Merseyside is the area of the Northwest of England that Liverpool is a part of. Merseyside is the bigger area because it encompasses not just Liverpool but Wirrall, Sefton, St. Helens etc.

5) ""Justice for the 96"" is an important phrase to us because it is in reference to [the Hillsborough Disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster) which was when 96 of our supporters died in a crush at Hillsborough Stadium in a FA Cup match against Nottingham Forest. 

Hope this all helps!

&gt;

&gt;The **Hillsborough disaster** was an incident that occurred on 15 April 1989 at the [Hillsborough Stadium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_Stadium) in [Sheffield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield), England, during the [FA Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup) semi-final match between [Liverpool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) and [Nottingham Forest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.) football clubs. The crush resulted in the deaths of 96 people and injuries to 766 others. The incident has since been blamed primarily on the police, and remains the worst stadium-related disaster in British history, and one of the world's worst football disasters. 

&gt;Football clubs used to contest the semi-final of the FA Cup at a [neutral venue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_venue), and in 1989 Hillsborough was selected by [The Football Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association) (FA). While opposing supporters were segregated in the stadium, Liverpool fans were allocated the Leppings Lane stand, reached by a limited number of turnstiles.  Entry to the ground was slow due to the few decrepit turnstiles available to the Liverpool fans, causing dangerous overcrowding outside the ground before kick-off. In an attempt to ease pressure outside the ground, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield ordered an exit gate to be opened. The opened exit gate led to a tunnel marked ""Standing"", which led directly to the two already overcrowded enclosures (pens). In previous years, the tunnel had been closed off by police when the two central pens were full; however, on this occasion the tunnel was unmanned.

&gt;The ensuing influx of supporters caused crushing, and some fans climbed over side fences or were lifted by fellow supporters onto the stand above to escape the crush. Moments after kick-off, a crush barrier broke, and fans began to fall on top of each other. The game was stopped after six minutes. To carry away the injured, supporters tore down advertising [hoardings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard) to use as stretchers, and emergency services were called to provide assistance. Of the 96 people who died, 14 were admitted to hospital. When the FA Chairman visited the Control Box to find out what had happened, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield told a ""disgraceful lie"",  that the supporters had ""rushed"" the gate.

Which is just reiterating the excuse you use to yourself. Doesn't hold up.

&gt;You can think what you like about people who use free services provided by the BBC.

It isn't just me.

&gt;It is akin to signing up to the free version of an anti-virus software or playing a free-to-play MMO and passing on the premium version.

Neither of which will ever be as good. Making both examples excellent parallels.

&gt;Do you think people who use free versions of anti-virus software are ""spongers""? Do you think people who play on free MMORPGs and not the premium version are ""spongers""?

I'd suggest your parallel (which you just repeated) would work better if you downloaded Symantec AV Corp client and then asserted that because you had the ability to do so, it's someone else's fault that you could. But well done for demonstrating the lengths you'll go to in order to avoid the responsibility.

France 4 owns the rights to show Dr Who in France. I assume they pay the BBC for that right, and that's one of the ways BBC makes money. Now, if the BBC started offering iPlayer in France, would they be able to have Dr Who on it? I'm sure France 4 wouldn't be too happy about that. Is it worth risking guaranteed income from sales of TV programs by putting them on international iPlayer?

Another example if series 3 of Ripper Street. It is being co-produced by the BBC and Amazon, and Amazon will get it for the first few months on Amazon Prime, while we'll get in on the TV later. If the BBC put Ripper Street on an international iPlayer, Amazon would probably get pissy, as it would be in direct competition with Amazon Prime.

An excuse implies I or anyone else needs to justify themselves to you. They don't. It is an explicit rejection of an excuse. I would not need an excuse for using Avast Antivirus for free, I don't need an excuse for using the BBC iPlayer.

&gt;Which is just reiterating the excuse you use to yourself. Doesn't hold up.

It is a basic response for how the comparison does not hold. The BBC is a service offered for free, or many aspects of it are. That is not my fault or anyone else's fault. The BBC should (and oddly enough I agree with you) make their iPlayer for TV License payers only. That they don't baffle me but I don't see the value in shouting at people for using a service willingly offered for free. If you want to complain, yell at the BBC.

No. Some other chap on this thread has a similar rage over this issue.

Other than that it doesn't appear to be a big issue.

&gt;Neither of which will ever be as good. Making both examples excellent parallels.

What's the relevance of ""Neither of which will ever be as good""? I'm not talking about their qualities but whether or not you think it is sponging to use the free version of software which is presumably at least in part funded by subscribers of said software.

true,mtempissmith,null,null,"I fell for 10 for much the same reasons I fell for 5, and later for 8. His sense of humor, his kindness, his caring, his warmth. He was a total badass in some ways, not a man I'd ever want to piss off, but he could also be the sweetest person in the universe, the best friend, the kind of guy who's just a joy to be around. Plus, let's face it Tennant is just a singularly and rather uniquely good looking guy. He's got a megawatt smile that's just contagious. He's total eye candy,innately sexy, knows it, and totally makes fun of it, which is hilarious. That comment he makes to Rose when he first comes back out of the Tardis in TCI ""Am I sexy?"" (Wink) it totally had me laughing even as I totally thought ""Yeah you silly bloke, you damn well sure are!"" 

I had not seen anything much of Tennant before that. I didn't get to see Casanova or anything else till after he got to play 10. But you can bet that after TCI I went back to play catch up with David Tennant, oh yeah, I sure did, and I totally enjoyed doing it too. There's this internet meme that jokes about how awesome he is, but it's not just a meme IMHO, he really IS, and I think that personality it shows in spades in his performance as The Doctor. He was totally born to play that role and he did it so well, and and had so much fun doing it that it was just contagious his sheer love of doing it. 

I truly miss him as 10. When I found out he was going to be in the anniversary special I could not help but grin. He was 10 for far too short a time for me. I could have gone 10 years with his Doctor and probably still wanted more. 10 definitely still left me wanting more. That's the bottom line. He never got old for me, ever.

true,Clarkinho,lfc68,,"Its quite common. He consistently collects the ball from migs or the CBs as he's sitting between them or a yard deeper than them. A lot of his long balls have come from that position. 

It's something I try to coach and a position I played so I pay extra attention to it when he does it. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXWq34XByjc) video shows it nicely at around 2.55. When we have the ball at the back, our fullbacks press right up to the halfway line and the CBs split a lot wider than a traditional split for Stevie to drop in between them (number 4 in Vid).

Lucas does not do this to nearly the same extent because he doesn't have the same passing range, not even close. He also plays with more energy working his way across the back line where as stevie plays a far more, deep lying static role now. 

Edit: In reference to your other comment - maintaining possession, recycling, and bouncing do not equate with being 'on offense'. Recycling and bouncing are about creating tempo, maintaining the ball and control, and preparing to transition to the next phase, which would then be about incising/penetrating or being on the 'offense' or however you want to word it. The centre backs split to each corner of the box to create the space to drop in when  we have the ball, I never said anything about defending. Their transition between attacking and defending is another conversation.
