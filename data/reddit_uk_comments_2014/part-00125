They are available through various nefarious ways (that can't be mentioned here) but if I can review said nefarious ways (that should at least be allowed) the streaming services stick adds in all the awful, wrong places and acquiring the episodes by peg-legging them requires you to always keep about 200 gigs on your hard drive free for doctor who.  That and the act of peg-legging them will take you the better part of two weeks to a month depending on your connection.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I get what you are saying and to a point i would agree, numerous thing Tim have said get pulled out of context and he ends up getting buried for the statement.

But, any number of his statements he rightfully gets attacked over because they are self serving, convey poor ideas or sound like he didn't stop and think before speaking.

Now our players absolutely get blamed for their lack of effort or mistakes.  Look on this board, you would think that Lennon is the spawn of satan that was deliberately sabotaging the season. Rose gets hammered on every mistake he makes (he makes quite a few), Ade gets called out for not hustling, Townsend, Walker, Dawson, Kaboul.....all of them catch hell for anything they do.  The media when we play poorly crushes our squad. The players are getting blame for poor performances, they may be getting it more than Sherwood is....when we win our players still catch blame for mistakes.

The funny thing is this piece that you wrote isn't far off from something Tim may actually say

&gt;  They didn't show up. They didn't play with passion (or play at all, in some cases). They made so many mistakes as to make them all look like amateurs out of their depth.

Its been one of things that genuinely bothered me about Tim. I get it that the players didn't play with passion, or fire or ""blood and thunder"", i get that they ""capitulated""...they deserve flack for it.  

However in those same games, they clearly weren't prepared to face their opponent. They were set up in a fashion that didn't put them in a position to succeed. There were no adjustments made....these are things that fall squarely at the feet of Tim.  Yet Tim doesn't take any responsibility for these failings, he hammers the squad and effectively absolves himself of any wrong doing.

His statements after the losses are nothing more than self-serving attempts to shift blame.  That is not a quality you want in a leader. That is not a quality you want in anyone associated with the squad. 

So i agree that Tim's words do get twisted, but to say that he is ""honest"" is a stretch, he deals in half truths and paints pictures to ensure that he is seen in the best light....he is a self-serving, self-righteous twat who can't exit this club fast enough.",0,1399065641,null,0,false,0,ch81x9x,t3_24jkbu,t1_ch81x9x,t1_ch804fk,null,1433624815,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

As a British Jew even though I don't really believe in religious grounding for the methods of slaughter and I am a strong believer in animal rights (although still a meat eater), I find myself confused and troubled.

I think that there is a problem here. The fact is Jews and Muslims have more visible signs of our faith, Halal and Kosher laws are just one example. 
With UKIP gaining ground, all the discrimination leveled against minorities by the other far-right, now becoming acceptable. Yes people have been concerned about this, from an animal rights perspective, for a long time, but there was never this much ruckus about stunning before Halal meat was targeted by the far-right as a form of the Islamification of Europe. 

I appreciate my position may be tricky to understand, but it's hard to articulate. I feel ever so slightly uncomfortable about this law even though I don't care about what meat I eat in the first place. 

Anyway, my interpretation of kosher slaughter was that it should be in the ""most humane way possible"" anyway. So maybe i'm just making a whole fuss over nothing.

It's a silly question; it doesn't make sense to quantify laws. A single Act of Parliament can go to thousands of sections. Or have 2. Same with EU directives. Some laws may only apply very briefly in a small area, others may apply everywhere forever. Some may have a huge impact on our lives (e.g. Net Neutrality?), others we may never notice the effects of.

I'd be careful with the use of 'usually'. Banks in the UK may be covered, however online services like transferwise are not. Foreign banks are not covered, with IceSave being an exception due to government intervention. However you are talking about banks when we are talking transfers companies.

&gt;I fail to see how the most popular bitcoin exchange earning tons in fees can go bankrupt, but it just did, didn't it?

How do you fail to see? The story is well covered with plenty of detail available. You are however comparing an actual exchange to an escrow system itself, which is obvious folly.

&gt;Not really, if someone hacks your fiat Internet bank then you have quite a bit of recourse. 

I said comparable services. That would be the likes of say, PayPoint, PayPal or Transferwise, not banks.

&gt;With bitcoin, I'd be out of luck.

First of all, you've suddenly changed from describing transfers to describing payments - just so you are aware. With bitcoin, no one can use your coins to pay for anything in the first instance, because they are YOURS unless you do something to jeopardise their security.

But again, your comparison is folly. Your comparing a service (banking), to a currency. Rather than a currency to a currency.

However, I'm not talking about the quote from the solicitor above, but the specifics of contracts and similar that often make stipulations about expected behaviour. i.e. employees are expected to behave in a manner that is inclusive, non-threatening and not to use language that might be perceived as racist, homophobic etc. Whether or not someone specifically finds it ""upsetting"" would be beside the point - I believe the rules are in place to prevent the possibility. Even if no-one in my office (openly) finds the word ""cunt"" to be explicit, I would expect my manager to take someone to task on using it because of the potential to upset, and because of the environment its use contributes to.

I don't think the Clarkson example in particular is really a subject of contention in any form of employment, outside various elements of the music industry of course.

First, what did you expect him to say? ""Oh good, we need a good gaffer around here""?   
  
Second, here is **Timmy's hard acts to follow:**  
1) integrate our youth players well even when we're full of expensive acquisitions (of varying quality). Bentaleb, Kane, Veljkovic -- these are the potential leaders for the future team.   
2) produce good performances and results.  Especially despite skepticism from the media and probably the newly-acquired squad players. Especially despite not having a decent fit fullback.  
3) criticize his own players when they deserve it.  
4) always acknowledge and thank the fans (and never criticizing them.. ahem)    
5) demonstrate that he may not be a tactical genius, but he has enough know how to duke it out on very even terms with Chelsea for a whole half of a match until the players collapsed (Vert, wtf).  Heck, he got the best out of Eriksen and Ade, which paid a ton of dividends. Also, we always play better after the half time chat.  At the very least, this means that whatever Timmy is doing is working better than whatever the opposition's gaffer is doing.  Maybe he does not have a glorious game system, but he has a *great eye* for players' strengths and attitudes, similarly to Arry's management style.   
6) very close familiarity with the prem, and a growing track record. 
  
I'll stop here.  Timmy is a good gaffer.  I'm not saying that there aren't better managers out there, but Timmy has done very well, and it would be nice if we acknowledged that.  Despite the attitude on this sub, Timmy has been pretty professional with the media and on the pitch.  I'm not sure that AVB would have reacted very calmly to Benfica manager's gesture either.

Players leave MLS for other leagues all the time but the money is improving and it's not always easy to arrange a transfer out because of the league ownership of registrations. Most of the stars who go to MLS aren't that old any more. It seems like players make the move around 30-32 now whereas the league was getting 36 year olds 10 years ago.

There's a definite quality of life component of going to MLS but just because you aren't in the Champions League doesn't mean there's no pressure. You're going to play in front of 18,000 fans most games which is roughly the same as Ligue 1 or The Championship and more than just about anywhere in South America.

Whether we paid £23m or £30m in today's money for Torres, we still got a couple of blistering seasons from him and then sold him for a huge profit. Before he got injured and went downhill he was prolific for us, and finished third in the Ballon d'Or. I can't see that happening with Lallana, at all.

I feel when buying a player for £20m they should be either a hugely exciting talent for the future, a player of exceptional quality, or basically ""shit we really need someone in this position and we'll accept paying over the odds"". I just don't feel Lallana is an astonishingly good player, and he's pretty much reaching his peak now and isn't likely to get much better.

The fact is that I'm not even sure if he'd be a guaranteed place in our starting XI ahead of Sterling, Coutinho or Suarez when he plays deeper, and I think that paying £20m for someone who might well spend half the season on the bench and isn't ever going to increase in value is a poor way to spend money. He'd be absolutely great cover for the extra games we'd have next season, but I'd rather we used good younger players and promising talent like Suso or Ibe to provide that, and spend big on areas where we need immediate improvement, than blow a good chunk of our transfer budget on someone who basically gives us something we already have.",0,1399071711,null,0,false,0,ch84fb1,t3_24j0rf,t1_ch84fb1,t1_ch7vx6b,null,1433626067,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

If people are standing it's near impossible to watch the match from a back row.

I never complained about it but going to the Bridge isn't cheap and it's certainly not enjoyable to watch a match with a hunch backed trying to peer through everybody.

The issue I have with this letter is that it seems he's being singled out for something that everybody on MHL does. Also taking his season ticket away seems incredibly harsh.

If the person in front of you is standing, you can't just sit behind him and watch the game. It's a vicious cycle which makes everyone being required to stand.

Largely, albeit more than one word, and such cases usually come down that. If you're looking at recent high profile cases of similar accusations, there's Coronation Street's Roache and Le Vell. Witness testimony was contradictory for both of those and it led to an aquittal for both. 

The difference between Clifford's case is that witness statements weren't contradictory (because they're telling the truth, or there was collusion between the witnesses, or through coincidence.) That's not always the case, but the CPS are now between a rock and a hard place. They have to prosecute, even if it's just he said / she said, and she's a liar. It's a Daily Mail paedo-panic witch hunt. 

In this case, maybe they actually caught one. He's fucked now, anyway, so we'd better hope he was guilty. The letter was a bit fucked up, so it's likely.

true,dan2802,eng-BlackCountry,Wulver'amptun,"Is this what the article says? Or what you believe? Either way, I've worked in butchers/abattoirs and have had had a temporary killing license.

&gt;Bolt stunning is horrific

Without using buzzwords please explain why. The animal is led into a channel, pops his head out of the end and bolted. There is no jerking, jumping or shouting. The only time cattle get upset in the trap is if their horns get stuck. Compared to killing methods twenty/thirty years ago, the slaughter is quick and efficient.

&gt;and often misses

Of the hundreds of cows that I've seen slaughtered and have slaughtered, there has only been one miss. The animal (A large British White bull), jerked when the bolt came down and was almost instantly shot with the back-up, as is standard practice. There are often two or three spare boltguns because there is a veterinarian there to ensure that the animal is given a quick and relatively painless death. If a person consistently misses the mark, they will have their license revoked.

&gt;Electrical stunning gives animals (edit) cardiac arrests! (And the brain stunning causes convulsions, that then cause unconsciousness)

The convulsions are a side effect of the stunning, not the cause. Boars, gilts, sheep and lambs are stunned using what is essentially a giant pair of electrical scissors which stun when applied to either side of the neck. It is instant.

&gt;After stunning, a blade twice the width of the animals neck is used to slice through both carotid arteries at once.

Again, wrong. The animals are lifted onto a chain by a hind leg and their throat is slit with a normal, extremely sharp knife. These were no wider than a ruler. This is standard practice, this even applies to Halal meat.

&gt;leading to unconsciousness in fractions of a second (if the animal wasn't previously stunned).

It can take anywhere from ten seconds to two minutes for an animal to bleed to death after having its throat slit without being stunned. A kosher slaughterhouse in the U.S. had video evidence that cows could stand up for over a minute after having their throat slit through Kosher slaughter.

&gt;I'd rather slaughter without the awful ""stunning"" that often fails, and results in plenty of pain.

Have you ever been inside an abattoir? Have you ever seen non-stunned slaughter? If not, please don't make such sweeping statements, stunned slaughter is much more humane than unstunned slaughter, it is quicker, less prone to error and less stressful to the animal.",0,1399080488,null,0,1399080790,0,ch87pc9,t3_24j7cx,t1_ch87pc9,t1_ch7rlmw,null,1433627612,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

That said, would missing the Europa League actually be financial hit?  

If we don't have Thursday night matches next year, we will have much too large a squad, with too many international players not getting game time.  I imagine we'd sell/loan at least 3-4 players.

Last season's run to the quarterfinal earned us 5.4 million EUR (4.4 million GBP).  As far as I can tell, the yearly wages of just Paulinho and Chiriches equal that much.

Now, maybe we'd sell Dembele and Kaboul instead, since both of them have health questions.  We'd probably sell at least one other CM -- probably Capoue -- as well as either Lennon or Sigurðsson (maybe both, but probably just Lennon, since Gylfi can nominally play in multiple positions and he's been better than Lennon this season).

But regardless, it would seem that trimming the squad will save more money than the Europa League would likely earn.

EDIT: I'm ignoring selling fees (since theoretically they'll be offset when we buy more depth when we finally make Champions League) and the possibility of new players coming in (since their fees and wages will theoretically be offset by selling additional players to make room), assuming that stuff will balance out.

EDIT 2: As I said, this does not reflect my actual preferences -- quite the opposite.  I want us to be in the EL next season.  I'd prefer to keep our big squad and play them in Europe than to sell them, play fewer matches, and then have to buy more players when/if (WHEN) we qualify for the CL!

true,Wolfgang_Wolf,,Ceredigion,"Walking through town, you may notice numerous branches of a shop called 'Polly'. They may appear to simply be shops selling a variety of overpriced craft goods, but the reality is far more sinister. Polly is a front for a shadowy organisation that controls Aberystwyth, which is also, unimaginatively, called Polly. Agents for Polly operate throughout the North Ceredigion area, being instructed via coded messages printed in the Cambrian news.

As you are a student, you should be aware of the Polly-sanctioned 'Student Exclusion Zones' that exist throughout the town. These zones include Penparcau, Plascrug Leisure Centre and the Vale pub. Access to the Exclusion Zones is denied to students at all times, with one exception. Transit through Penparcau for students is permitted for holders of a special transit pass, valid only on certain days at the beginning and end of term. The Penparcau Student Transit Pass can only be obtained by hand delivering an application form to a Polly branch five years in advance. All application forms must be completed in Welsh.

Any student found in a Student Exclusion zone without the necessary documentation will be taken away by Polly agents (or in the case of Penparcau, members of the 'Arky crew', who are Polly puppets). They will then be marched up Pendinas, hoisted to the top of the Wellington monument and left as a warning to other students to not break the rules.

There was no way of knowing for sure if he'd score a ton or be just your average striker before we bought him is what I meant to say, sorry if it came across as more nitpicky.

I agree I can't see Lallana winning the Ballon d'Or, but not every signing that we make can or will. I feel like he has yet to reach his peak, and that's just my opinion. I'd say he would fight with Coutinho for a place in the XI which is good, and I think Ibe still needs a few years development before becoming a regular sub/starter in Cup games. I'd love to see Suso come back and play, but even having him in the side, we'll still need more depth in the squad.

I don't think £20m is too much, as he's got talent, and if we do go for him, it must mean that BR and the transfer board think he can still develop and can add something to the team that we don't already have, or that we do have but need more of. Considering that Henderson was £20m, most thought he was rubbish, and he's grown into that fee that we paid; I feel like Lallana could be similar, people will have divided opinions on him, but that ultimately he'll be good for the team.

It isn't Orwellian in any way shape or form. All he was doing was voicing an opinion, you may find his opinion to be repulsive, but it is just that, an opinion. That you would invoke Orwell for an argument against freedom of speech is a grotesque perversion of his thought, in both content and spirit. It is you, not I, that wishes to restrict someones freedom of thought and speech, which is the bedrock of the Ingsoc state. And so it is you, not I, that is employing Orwellian language; euphemising totalitarian laws as fluffy and kind and for the benefit of the public. 

&gt;Factually incorrect. Read the OP. He was arrested for two counts: 1. failure to obey a police dispersal order (you know, the one he was given because he was pissing everyone around him off with his megaphone antics)

A single person cannot be charged with the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 because it requires [""two or more people""](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/dispersal_orders/). And, if your criterion for punishment is that he was ""pissing everyone around him off with his megaphone antics"", then the average street preacher or busker could be indicted. (You also apparently do not know the meaning of your own words: you have mentioned several times his ""megaphone antics"", which would imply that his only transgression is the volume of his words, not the words themselves. I would find this cognitive dissonance surprising if you weren't advocating suppression of free speech, an argument which necessarily requires pretzel shaped contortions of thought.) 


&gt;2. inciting racial or religious hatred. That second point is not one that ""anyone"" can get arrested under, especially not charged, it's one that you get arrested under if you are giving a big speech about how another race or religion is unwelcome in Britain and there's plenty of evidence because you're doing it in public like Weston.

The racial and religious hatred bill should be repealed immediately and everyone punished under it should be publicly exonerated. It is a truly totalitarian law. 

&gt;That second point is not one that ""anyone"" can get arrested under, especially not charged, it's one that you get arrested under if you are giving a big speech about how another race or religion is unwelcome in Britain and there's plenty of evidence because you're doing it in public like Weston.

Perhaps you haven't been paying attention, I have been arguing that we should not be able to be arrested for giving a ""big speech"" about anything, regardless of how much one might disagree with it. (And for the hygiene of an elementary distinction - Paul Weston said nothing about anyone being unwelcome in Britain, and even if he did that would not make one iota of difference) 

&gt;If you can provide me some evidence of how you, or I, or the public at large are at danger of being arrested under charge no.2 without first trying to incite racial or religious hatred I'd love to hear it.

Everyone is at risk because it is an extremely subjective and arbitrary law. 


&gt;As for everything else you've said: If you're going to make a straw man instead of talking to me like an adult then you can just sod off and talk amongst your own whatever-ideology-you-subscribe-to.

It wasn't a straw man, you want and desire opinions you don't like to be suppressed, if you were honest you would admit that, but you wont because you are a milquetoast liberal with neither courage nor convictions. 

My ideology doesn't have a name, if it had a mantra it would be ""If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.""

You're best avoiding Coronation St as it's set in Lancashire. Also, careful with Emmerdale as only about half the accents in that are true Yorkshire, the rest are mostly Lancashire or Tyne &amp; Wear. Listen to characters like Nick, Charity, Chastity, Bell, Paddy, Marlon, Jimmy and Lisa for a proper Yorkshire accent. (You can usually tell a Lancashire accent if you listen to them for a bit, as they tend to say 'air' sounds as 'urr' sounds, eg. there becomes thurr and hair becomes hurr.)

In Game of Thrones, as well as Ygritte, you should listen to Ned Stark, Jon Snurrrr, Samwell (who probably has the most Yorkshire accent in it right now) and Samwell's ladyfriend with the baby (I forget her name, sorry).

As others have suggested, listen to lots of Sean Bean, especially in Sharpe and GoT as that's when he's at his most Yorkshire.

Also, try to listen to South Yorkshire accents the most (like Millen's) as they tend to be thickest and the easiest to learn from.

&gt;

&gt;The __law of averages__ is a [layman's term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layman%27s_terms) used to express a belief that outcomes of a random event will ""even out"" within a small sample.

&gt;As invoked in everyday life, the ""law"" usually reflects bad statistics or wishful thinking rather than any mathematical principle. While there is a [real theorem that a random variable will reflect its underlying probability over a very large sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), the law of averages typically assumes that unnatural short-term ""balance"" must occur.  Typical applications of the law also generally assume no [bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) in the underlying probability distribution, which is frequently at odds with the [empirical evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence). [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;

&gt;__Jean-Marc Bosman__ (born 30 October 1964) is a former Belgian [footballer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football),  whose [judicial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial) challenge of the [football transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_transfer) rules led to the [Bosman ruling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosman_ruling) in 1995. This landmark judgement completely changed the way footballers are employed, allowing professional players in the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) to move freely to another club at the end of their term of contract with their present team.

&gt;Prior to the landmark trial, Bosman played for Belgian first division club [Standard de Liège](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_de_Li%C3%A8ge)  and [RFC Liège](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_Li%C3%A8ge) and won 20 caps for Belgium at youth level. While the trial was ongoing Bosman played briefly in the French lower leagues, and on the Indian Ocean island of [Réunion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9union).

&gt;Since Bosman won his case, it was claimed by *[The Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom\))* that he has lost the money he won from his case and has descended into alcoholism and depression whilst living on social benefits.  Some of his money was lost due to a bad investment in a special T-shirt line. Bosman hoped that the players who benefited from the Bosman ruling would support him by buying one of his T-shirts. He sold only one, to the son of his lawyer. In order to pay his taxes, he was forced to sell his second house and his [Porsche Carrera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_Carrera).

The outrage also has to do with his history of pushing a certain type of borderline racist jokes in his programs, and his history of publically expressing some very strong conservative viewpoints. 

Ie, things like when he interviewed some audience members about what cars they like - he stops at a young man from india or pakistan and asks him ""so what kind of car do you like to steal?"" Can you imagine a white US talkshow host asking one of the few black members of the audience that? 

Or his comment about how striking workers should be shot in front of their families. Or calling former PM Gordon Brown ""a one-eyed scottish cunt"".

---

&gt;In [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory), the __birthday problem__ or __birthday [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox)__  concerns the [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) that, in a set of *n* [randomly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random) chosen people, some pair of them will have the same [birthday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday). By the [pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle), the probability reaches 100% when the number of people reaches 367 (since there are 366 possible birthdays, including February 29). However, 99.9% probability is reached with just 70 people, and 50% probability with 23 people. These conclusions include the assumption that each day of the year (except February 29) is equally probable for a birthday. The history of the problem is obscure, but [W. W. Rouse Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._W._Rouse_Ball) indicated (without citation) that it was first discussed by an ""H. Davenport"", almost certainly [Harold Davenport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Davenport).

Just have a look at the comment section and you'll find ample verified stats that counter the, frankly, poorly written piece, as well as provide a much clearer definition of the role of a holding defensive midfielder. 

One overlooked aspect of Lucas' game is how well he manages space on the pitch. He both fills the gaps that prevent fluid movement from the opposition, while provides an outlet in those spaces unmanaged by opposing sides. It is by no means exciting and is easy to miss, but vital to the success of a team. 

Unfortunately, it seems a player's worth is only valued when on the ball, which most certainly is not the case. 

As for rash challenges, just look at other DMs in Europe and see the similarities. Even while at Liverpool, Both Alonso and mascherano were guilty of the very same charges aimed at Lucas: plenty of cards, poor challenges, etc, but this is somewhat expected in that role when you're constantly closing down players and making more challenges than any other player on the pitch, particularly when protecting your CBs. 

Yes, his distribution may be less incisive and flashy than our current roster of midfielders, but it is effective at maintaining possession. 

Lastly, I can't argue that he's been less effective than seasons past, but I truly believe he's yet to fully recover from his last injury, as well as having to slot into an unfamiliar role.

or just that there are no victims from the earlier or later periods that have come forward with complaints.

this was a thirty five year old guy who suddenly decided to molest teen girls. he had help in his endeavors, so likely he was on somebodies blackmail list.

true,NiiLamptey,null,null,"That is pretty telling, and a good point. I think a lot of supporters presume because we have a big ground and our average attendances is often around the top six that this is our fair level. But it says a lot that West Ham, Spurs and obviously Chelsea make a lot more than on match day turnover, despite having smaller grounds. 

Spurs made nearly 3x as much in match day receipts despite a ground that holds nearly 8,000 less people. Obviously London pricing plays a part but people have to realise that we have one of the cheapest pricing structures in the division, which impacts on our turnover. Clearly performances and the AM effect impacted this - our attendances and season ticket sales have dropped since MON left. We also have quite a large 'floating' supporter base. We'll always have that core support of 30-35,000 but we only fill the ground when things are going well, or a 'marquee' team are in town who bring a load of fans. I've said it before that if Villa Park was slightly smaller I think our attendances and turnover would actually be higher due to supply and demand.

I think, and I'm only guessing here, that year was not typical of the last decade or so and improvements on the pitch would soon see our turnover increase as we have a lot of things in place to capitalise. 

That said, ticket prices are only a proportion of it, it's the commercial and overseas revenue that would jump up of we started to achieve on the pitch. It would be interesting to see if there's been any improvement in the match day hospitality revenue since the controversial reworking of the Trinity middle tier seating. 

Overall, it's frightening to see how much Man Utd's turnover completely dwarves ours. I think the game has changed so much since the 90s and they've secured their global position to the extent that we'll never again be able to compete with them on a regular basis.

true,kern_q1,null,null,"&gt; And Liverpool will probably win the title with stylish football with less then half our budget and one of our ex-strikers being one of their top scorers, the irony.

If Liverpool win, it is because of their incredible strong run this year. 11 wins on the bounce and if they win it, it will be 13/14 wins. Lets not forget that despite this incredible hot vein of form, one loss was enough to take it out of their hands. 

&gt; I would rather try to outscore a team then try and concentrate solely on keeping a clean sheet.

We couldn't do that. I don't think we've won a single game this season when we've conceded two goals. We've dominated periods of play with nothing to show for it. 

I think Jose was talking about the Carling cup loss to Sunderland. We dominated that match but had only one goal to show. We then proceeded to concede late in the second half and managed to concede again as we pushed for a winner. We were conceding from set pieces. Something that we are generally strong in. And I remember posts here asking Jose to sort out the defense.

&gt; I really don't think Mourinho should be complaining about our players. We have more then enough quality to have at least won one of the 7(?) seven trophies available for us this season. 

We should not have lost to Sunderland in Carling cup and we should have won the league. Rest of the defeats were tight affairs or against better teams. For whatever reason, we just were not scoring.

The first a Gismondo journalist knew about his accounts being hacked was when his iPhone shut itself down - he plugged it into his Macbook and that locked him out, too. [more info: [1](http://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/), [2](http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/journalist-blames-apple-tech-for-allowing-icloud-hack/)]

It turned out that someone had phoned Amazon and added a new credit card (a fake one) as an additional payment method to the journalist's account, then subsequently used that card number as a security identifier to gain access to his Amazon account.

Accessing the payment methods page of the journalist's Amazon account gave the hacker the last 4 digits of his *real* credit card number, and this was used as a security answer to access his Apple ID (which was what was used to trigger the ""stolen device"" procedures on the Mac &amp; iPhone).

It's too early yet to say how Griffin's account was hacked, but if a creative hacker just keeps trying to [socially engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_\(security\)) the accounts of enough people, with enough persistence and determination, sooner or later they'll be successful.

European - Joao Carlos Teixeira (AM) (Portugal), Pedro Chirivella (CM) (Spain), Sergi Canos (AM) (Spain), Harry Wilson (AM) (Wales)

Also, there's a couple of other youngsters on the fringe of our youth squads that our out on loan.

Players like Jack Robinson (LB) and Conor Coady (CM) who are both English were touted as big future prospects a few years ago, so they may be able to break through through the ranks. Suso (AM) (Spain) is the obvious choice for most promising loanee, and the only reason I'm including him is his age. 

Also Stephen Sama (CB) (Germany), although he doesnt play much for the youth teams has looked good at times, so he is my dark horse.

true,linkschode,null,null,"Here's my experience with the NHS recently: 

I am a professional drummer and builder. I was involved in a motorcycle accident, and separated my right shoulder (I am right handed). There are various grades of this, anything below a grade 2 doesn't require surgery, grade 3 - 5 do.

I get taken to hospital, X-Rayed, and told all I need to do is keep it in a sling and have some physio, and that it is a grade3. No option for surgery. Go back to a checkup in a week, and they confirm this. Due to now disfigured shoulder, I decide this isn't acceptable, locate a private shoulder specialist. He takes one look at the X-Ray, and is amazed at the diagnosis. He says I need surgery immediately if I wish to regain full use of my shoulder as it is a grade 4 - 5. He also says had I left it another few days, I wouldn't be able to have this re-setting surgery as the ligament would have scarred over, but instead would have to have a more complicated and less effective reconstructive surgery.

Cost £5500, I'm still out of pocket and fighting to get the money back. Yes I'm thankful the NHS is there are a safety net, but do not be fooled into thinking they are experts, or will even give you the correct information. Had I listened to them, I would be disfigured with a dysfunctional shoulder, with pain and further problems in my future. The problem is the trust your general member of the public puts in the NHS - this trust is totally misplaced. 

EDIT: The reason I paid for the first surgery was because there was no WAY I would be able to get a GP referral in a couple of days for surgery. The surgery to remove the metal plate I had put in was done on the NHS, and didn't cost me anything. 

Also, another friend of mine was involved in a serious motorcycle accident, and severely broke both arms and legs among other things. He received great care, all for free, and made a full recovery. So it's not always bad. But also, it's not always good as you would expect if you were paying top money out of your own pocket. Personally, I would happily pay significantly more just to ensure that everyone received the best possible treatment money can buy at the present time.

the danger of having so much property value tied up with people who don't have any skin here is that if a new investment becomes flavour of the month these people might cash out and go elsewhere.

What I find particularly annoying is that we've set things up to benefit certain people in British society. Punish the poor, help the homebuyer.

Rakitic is perhaps wishful thinking, as we've not been linked to him particularly heavily. Ramires isn't going anywhere, sadly, but Luiz is.

Do we go for experience? Try and consolidate in the top half? I wouldn't be that surprised if, without Cortese, we see a less ambitious approach from our owners over the next few years. Would that mean an experienced man in charge, who knows the premier league, and who would keep us in the top half? One man would fit that bill incredibly well - David Moyes.  
  
If we go for a similar option to Pochettino, a young manager who's shown talent, that gives a few options. One that I'd quite like to see is Eddie Howe. Sure, he did pretty rubbish at Burnley but his stints at Bournemouth have been very impressive. Might not be that easy to prise him away from Bournemouth again, and his links to Pompey may make it a challenge to win over some fans. 
  
Looking at the odds karoz posted, I genuinely can't believe some of the names on there. Redknapp?! Who's he gonne have as assistant, Pardew? That would be a dream team of sorts I suppose.
  
Also, Shearer and Le Tissier should be absolutely nowhere near the job. Allardyce?!, Billy Davies??!! Paul Fucking Ince!!!

true,William_bear,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"Although it got a lot of flak, I actually think that the change to tuition fees was a good step, because it taxes those who can afford to pay, and means that most people will pay less.  It's the closest thing to a graduate tax the LibDems could get the Tories to agree to, and I think because of that compromise, much of the intuition was undermined.

So why do I think it was good?  Because there's no up-front need to pay, and the threshold before you start paying back is so high (£21k), it's the grads who have gained from university and are now earning more than most people who are the ones who pay the most.  For many under the new system, they won't pay a penny and won't have tuition fee debt at all.

Where did it go wrong?  Admittedly, much of the implementation has been downright dire.  Selling off the loan book, adding extra interest (meaning that the payments-cost distribution is skewed), removing maintenance grants, lowering government funding for unis etc. all were terrible ideas that made the whole package completely unpalatable.  But if the fees system change had been mildly different (and it had just been the fees-&gt;graduate tax change), it could have been one of the most progressive moves for higher education availability in a decade:

- No up-front fees
- No actual debt, only a tax on graduate earnings (up to a limit)
- Only those in the top ~40% of earners pay anything (£21k ~= £17k post-tax, and calculated [here](http://www.theguardian.com/society/datablog/interactive/2012/jun/22/how-wealthy-you-compared) )

Yes, yes I do.

I've worked in the UK hedge fund industry and asset management (long only), as well as rather more briefly the sell side in equities.  It's a very small world, there are very few large funds in the UK.  The thing is, it isn't as if it was the only fund selected, or they had a disproportionately large allocation compared to their peers.

Also the money involved is somewhat towards the chump change end of the scale.   Really for their fund £36m isn't really anything.  But also more than that, you could have *made* some of that quite easily without the need for having the shares issued.  It's unfair to suggest that the IPO was purposefully so low, as if this was the case, if it was some scheme, they would have made a lot more than £36m, they would have taken more interesting long structures that would have allowed high leverage.

So in recap, £36m is nothing for a fund, they won't risk something corrupt over so little, that £36m is unfair number (you simply don't talk about investment like this) they didn't do anything interesting or special and leverage up to earn more.",0,1399116440,null,0,false,0,ch8gdfy,t3_24luhf,t1_ch8gdfy,t1_ch8g8xw,null,1433631760,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; I know nothing about corporate banking other than from what I have learnt in the news over the past painful few years, so I am willing to be proven wrong, but my automatic assumption is that every single man, woman and company involved in corporate banking is corrupt to an extent, whether it be out and out illegal activities, or more subtle activities that which may be lawful but far from good for the wider society. Therefore Chinese partitions do not give me any comfort at all.

I'll be honest, I give up on here.  People love the idea of banker bashing.  At the time of the credit crunch I was working for a large UK hedge fund, I used to tell people I worked in programming language research at parties and the like, because they had such prejudice about our industry.

I've never heard tale, not even gossip or speculation of a Chinese wall failing at the places I've worked.  The problem is the person who discloses the information, has a lot to loose, and it would be hard for them to gain in any way that isn't trivial to detect.

This isn't to say that everyone is above board the whole time, and morally questionable activities that are entirely legal don't happen all the time.  But I've never heard of someone breaking a wall like this, it's simply too hard, too risky and not profitable.

&gt;As you say, 8 million is small beer so why allow it at all? Take away the right for the company to benefit from its own failings.

There is an issue here in that you think of as one company, isn't one legal entity.  The other problem is you want companies that have experiances in IPOs, they are hard as evidenced by how often they are done, just like this one, suboptimally.  How would you then restrict that firm trading that equity?  Imagine if you were an investment bank unable to ever trade say Apple again?  You wouldn't be interested in doing the IPO process!

&gt;they are paid to do a good job, and clearly in this case they did not

Not true.  They are paid for the IPO.  It went OK, it wasn't troubled, it was non-optimal.  It could easily have been worse.  How many IPOs have you followed?  Why do you say it is bad because it is trading at higher value so soon after, most successful IPOs do this!

Of course not every article is critical of the BBC, but it seems overwhelming stuff is spun to primarily blame to BBC for things (such as the Clarkson thing, running along the lines of blaming the BBC for their response, and ignoring wider media shit stirring). 

And the comments, they are of gold mine. Top comments comparing the BBC to a 'left wing propaganda club', calling it an affront to democracy, saying it was good before 'PC journalists' took over, saying how it is basically a 'PC Gestapo' or 'left wing thought police'. 

Now, while I'm not saying people can't be critical of the BBC, and the actions of the BBC, this at least shows there are plenty of people out there who do not 'recognise the extraordinary value of the BBC'. Telegraph readers obviously don't support it, judging by the comments and the directions of the articles.

&gt;*waits for someone to post the stephen fry macro about being offended*

Thanks. There are several problems with your reply. 

First of all, could you please stop being such a wanker. That is unnecessary. 

Secondly you say that ""you wouldn't walk up to a PoC and call them nigger"". I assume by PoC you mean person of colour. Even if true, however, this is not what Clarkson did. That's important. Context is key. 

Thirdly, it's not true. If you're black you might well do. I am and I call my friends ""nigger"" all the time. This confirms, by the way, that you are not, as I suspected. 

Fourthly, if the term  is not wrong for me and my black buddies, it's not obvious why it should be silly to ask why it's wrong for you, my obviously white friend. 

Fifthly, you say ""Those boundaries are set"". Agreed. They are. But that doesn't make them right or any questioning of them silly. You have yet to explain that. 

Sixthly, you say ""anyone who wishes to cross them is just being a contrarian"". This may be, but you haven't explained what is wrong with being a contrarian, if by that you mean running contrary to the prevailing mood. You may mean being contrary for the sake of it but there is no indication that is what the commenter is doing. Running contrary to the prevailing mood perfectly describes those activists who fiercely advocated for the rejection of the term in the first place, back when it was acceptable and people thought so little of it it became a staple of nursery rhymes. If being contrary is wrong, then establishing these boundaries in the first place was wrong. I can't believe you think so. Perhaps better to remain open to all questions and doubts and think straight instead of accepting the prevailing norm. 

Finally, your use of the phrase ""justifying their bigotry"" begs the question at issue: was he being bigoted?

&gt;What, besides free trade and free markets, does The Economist believe in? ""It is to the Radicals that The Economist still likes to think of itself as belonging. The extreme centre is the paper's historical position."" That is as true today as when former Economist editor Geoffrey Crowther said it in 1955. The Economist considers itself the enemy of privilege, pomposity and predictability. It has backed conservatives such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. It has supported the Americans in Vietnam. But it has also endorsed Harold Wilson and Bill Clinton, and espoused a variety of liberal causes: opposing capital punishment from its earliest days, while favouring penal reform and decolonisation, as well as—more recently—gun control and gay marriage.

But its writers argue this position from the facts, and aren't afraid to talk about the downsides and problems.

&gt;Context is key.

Well , yes. But it is an important context here too. Clarkson was happy to do this in on set, confident it would be cut out. That implies an element of comfort of using the word and an element of acquiescence from the production team. It's completely possible to argue that use of the word in this context implies that Clarkson is happy to think that using ""nigger"" in that context is perfectly fine. Which raises all sorts of questions about what is deemed to be acceptable and whether the BBC should a environment where that attitude should exist. 

&gt;I am and I call my friends ""nigger"" all the time. 

Yeah, and there's been a huge debate about it in the Black community about it. The reason that its used is completely different, though I've never really been convinced by it, but you say context is key. Those people that do use it use it as a way of equalising and including others. It's also been argued that it is a way of ceasing back word and owning so it can no longer be offensive. 

I don't think it works, but the reasoning is different and so is context. Clarkson uses it as someone who is a product of power and privileged without the cultural discussion about it. Rappers use it for a different reason, linked explicitly with challenging the power and privilege (grant that its so far gone in Hip Hop and other places it may not connect with the original intent)

The Royal Mail's profits go [up and down](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/20/royal-mail-profits-dive) and that is unstable. By privatising the Royal Mail, it will run more efficiently and in a way that is more prepared to adapt to the market.

Anti-privatisation: Royal Mail is turning a profit and operating quite healthily at the moment. If we privatise it, we are going to see costs going up as the company becomes answerable to its' shareholders rather than the public.

Danny Rose has fucked us twice today.  Poor positional sense on Kaboul's red, and a shit pass for Dawson's yellow.  Both fouls led to goals.  I still don't think that Kaboul fouled Downing, but I'm clearly alone in that thought.  Looking at the gif, I don't believe Kaboul pulled Downing back.  He didn't clip his legs, he didn't push him over or come through his back.  His forearm banged into Downing's shoulder, and that somehow means Downing can't work his legs.  I wouldn't call that foul on anyone.

true,wrigley2345,eng-dorset,Dorset (Living in USA),"I think the reason that quite a few of these Councillors are saying these things is because UKIP is growing so fast. It's very hard to vet potential Councillors for things like this (although they do try very hard to) on this big of a scale, and the fact that they are kicked out as soon as they make these views known is a good indicator that they are not acceptable for UKIP's ideals. By 2020, when UKIP may have a big chance of getting real power, they should have a far cleaner selection of politicians and activists.

&gt; The question UKIP should be asking is 'Why are there so many racists in our party if we claim to not be a racist party? What attracts them here?'

What attracts them is the lack of real action on immigration by the three (pretty much two now) main parties. 

There are two different who people don't like immigration. One, realising the economic toll that the huge levels of immigration of low wage, unskilled workers has on the country. They don't hate the actual immigrants, just the laws. They are for controlled immigration, with less bias towards EU migrants. People with this view are not limited to just the right side of the political spectrum either. Increasingly, it is a nonpartisan issue. 

Then there are those who actually hate immigrants. They either have had bad experiences with the effects of the large scale immigration over the last few years, or they are basing it off false information and hyperbole from tabloids. They generally want to stop immigration entirely. 

Luckily, the former are in the vast majority. But the latter do unfortunately exist. As UKIP are the only ones who will actually get something done about immigration, the racists, unfortunately, are attracted to UKIP. Fortunately they are in the vast minority of supporters, and hopefully by turning to UKIP instead of the BNP or other nationalist parties, they can be shown that it isn't the immigrants fault, and that controlled immigration has a benefit for the country.  If we ignore them, then they fester and stew until they create groups such as the EDL and increasingly become more and more dangerous.

&gt;Is it really such a sin to take offensive on another's behalf? Even if people do get over-excited, surely over-active empathy is better than the opposite?

Yes, it *can* lead to bad consequences.  Much conflict - in fact, perhaps the majority is because of 'moral outrage' and 'defending honor'.  Even on reddit, it's clear that overactive moral indignation leads to a fantastic amount of bullying and bad feeling.

Just look at this case.  People who are quick to find outrage are calling for Clarkson to lose his show and his career.  That's a consequence.

It's a fascinating topic.  Many people assume that empathy is always a good thing, but perhaps our celebration of empathy as a quality to be desired has gone too far.  Who does more for the world?  A highly empathic person who devotes her life to teaching children Bible stories or someone like Bill Gates?  Gates probably ranks quite low on the empathy scale, and yet, because he's very analytical, he's able to direct money to causes like malaria which actually make the biggest difference, rather than just throw his money at whatever tugs on his heart-strings the most.

Reducing my taxes. I am on a comfortable wage (just below 40% tax rate) and I keep seeing my take home increase due to tax changes. I don't understand why I should be getting a tax cut when they are cutting essential services?

Closing Remploy.

Changing law so people don't have to buy a annuity. So many financially illiterate people are just going to take their whole pension fund as a lump sum, and we are going to be left with destitute pensioners.

Borrowing money to spend on foreign aid. Boomers get to feel good about themselves, even though its actually their grandkids who will pay for it.

Constantly changing their minds about the type of F-35 we are going to use on the new carriers.

Dilly-dallying over HS2. Get it started already!!!

Bringing the FSA into the Bank of England. The Bank of England pay shit wages and all their best people now work for banks or as consultants.

The PRA bringing in a 'Leverage Ratio'. This punishes banks who lend sensibly and does nothing to deter risky lending.

Good: 

Disability Reviews. I get that ATOS did a shit job of it, and lots of people got fucked by it, but there were lots of people on disability benefits who just weren't eligible for it. There needs to be a periodic review of eligibility, but obviously it should have been based on condition and not just done on everyone. It isn't a nice or popular thing to do, but the government only has a limited amount of money and it had to be done eventually.

Opposing Eurozone Tobin Tax implementation. The Eurozone countries shouldn't be able to unilaterally impose measures on the rest of the EU.

Renewing Trident. Stops the Russians treating us like their Bitch (see Ukraine)

Backing fracking. Incresed energy independence combined with reduction in coal use at a time when our old Nuclear plants are being decomissioned.

Staying the fuck out of Syria.

I actually totally agree with you. Empathy obviously needs to be paired with common sense and a respect for other's points of view and freedom of thought/speech or else it can be just as dangerous as intolerance.  I think we should all definitely be discussing what Clarkson said, but in no way should we try and silence him, or ban him from our tellies just because some people got a bit offended. 

I think it's good to have a discussion about what level of offense is generally tolerated in public discourse, especially around minority/non 'mainstream' groups that might not have the largest public voice to be heard. And that's obviously an issue of a basic level of empathy and self-consciousness. But it's also an interesting point whether it's objectionable to take offense on another's behalf in such a way. I can definitely see why some minorities/groups might think this sort of over-reaction is patronising, or some form of left-over 'colonial guilt'.

I have to say in the past I've been guilty of just blithely considering us a bigger team than Everton, Newcastle and even Spurs.. and I found it frankly shocking to find us operating with lesser means than West Ham, who I've always considered a quaint little yoyo club. As three of these teams are contemplating moving to improved/increased capacity stadiums in the foreseeable future it's possible our position could soon be cemented behind them which is slightly depressing.  

That said, I think you may be right in terms of this being an under performing season in financial terms so perhaps a swing of £10m (I'm just pulling that figure out of the air obviously but it doesn't seem unreasonable) or so is conceivable if we start to pull ourselves out of the doldrums.  Even if that happens however, though we might overhaul Everton, West Ham, and maybe even Newcastle.. we'd still be packed relatively close with them while the teams beyond that, starting with Spurs are a world away.   

I think the important thing to take away from this is that if we ever do find ourselves competing for a Europa League place, we should be absolutely delighted and enjoy it, rather than falling into the trap of complaining that the current regime/manager needs to be ambitious to take us to ""the next level"". I remember Charlton fans doing exactly that when they were a Premier League fixture under Alan Curbishley and ""only"" finishing in mid table every year; which in retrospect is a great illustration of the inherent hubris/delusion of most football fans :D

On a side note you're absolutely right about Man Utd, ironically the football world may owe a debt to the Glazers! If they hadn't been sucking hundreds of millions of pounds out of the club for the last decade then this could be a one team league by now. As it is their only real competition has come from the billionaire clubs.. which makes the future under FFP look bleak for us all.

true,DeaJae,eng-Cambridgeshire,Desolate Cambridgeshire Fens,"* Ruined education for current students (again), I went through this last time sitting my exams when GCSE's were brought in and staff/students totally unprepared for.. Sure it was a Tory government then too.  
*Removal or localized services such as tax and business advice centres. I for one like to speak face to face with experts/advisers.. Phones just don't cut it with me.  
* Legal aid and professional bodies.  
* Welfare system needed a change, but this is just a rushed up clusterbomb of a mess.  
* Political representation, that MP recall bill would of been very useful to restore public faith. In fact I'd like it extended to PCC and local councillors who seem to be fond of being a bit silly.. (I apologize for being in an area with 2 UKIP councillors being in the news for quite bad reasons..)  
* Police Crime Commissioners.. It may of been a good idea, I have issues where it politicizes a role what should be professional. The election could of been handled much better, I didn't vote in this because I didn't even get any information, The candidates never even bothered to put out anything more than 'who we are' thing from their site, and again I don't really want regional police prioritized by political reasons. Also from the notes from local community groups meetings with our local, think he needs unelecting so he can get some sleep, since that's his excuse for missing them 9pm meetings.  
* Tax Allowances, nice but wages and job numbers still not going up.  
* Destruction of community groups and charities who started up to fulfil a need the government couldn't.  
* HMRC still not functioning properly.  
* Border Control still a mess.  
* High Speed rail (or HS2), Yes okay we probably do need it.. But can't we just build parts of the network to incorporate more stations and refine it so it gets to a workable stage for the whole country inside of just 1 route up and down which'll break down regularly as passengers cross it? 1 thing what annoys me about trains is that I have to go 80 miles to London and wait a while for another train for a location only 40 miles from me if I avoided London.  
* Banks, They screwed up.. end of. And they are still pushing that attitude. Was hoping that the part taxpayer owned RSB and Lloyds would of helped plug the gap they created in the Treasury, It probably already done it but we aren't seeing or hearing it.  
* Help to Work, Work Programmes, Job Centres... Most troublesome things yet. Having worked through the system. Being put on courses which were a waste of money (which I also had to cancel interviews for..), Travelling to Work Programme for no reason. It's not helping at all.. Relevant work experience might, but not how workfare does it. I'd actually suggest letting the local colleges handle that part except they seem to be muscling in on the 'Free DWP cash for keeping claimants out of sight' era we are stuck in.  
  
* Civil wages out of touch with real world. Prime example being the already wealthy PCC's who currently earn more than MP's.. Guessing most of these were already MP's before this role  
**But its not all Gloom and Doom, here's my good bits**
* Business support seems to be booming (if you have the money and be in the cities you seem to get a better deal!)  
* BT has been given a big kick up the arse (cash incentive) to actually upgrade the UK communications network), again the bid process is something I'm not happy about as there was very little independents bidding or getting near.  
* A lot more people now thinking about their vote and where it gets us, This could be pushed more with transparency and the ability to show we aren't happy with certain things.. Make this democracy a proper democracy for all and not just some.  
  
A fair few points come down to execution, either its good and its not been talked about to publicized at all, or its terrible and been pushed as fast as possible and not thought out at all.

I'd be happy for him to stay, but he hasn't been able to show his quality for a good long while now, every time he comes back from injury, he suffers another setback so he's never able to gain full fitness.

There is risk involved, and these fund managers are after all using other peoples money to do this government IPO and trying to provide a floor price.  If the IPO had not gone smoothly due to market sentiment, then I doubt anyone would be complaining.

Yes facebook was a tech stock, but have a look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering_of_Facebook it chronicles how optimism in the media and *people in the know* wasn't backed up by market sentiment.  The interesting thing is, those who bought even at the opening high of $45, will today have made a good return, maybe even 50% in 18 months if they'd sold at best peak.

So despite facebook's IPO being *too low* when looking back from today, they actually had the underwriters buying up the shares because the market wasn't interested.

The Post Office is one of those companies that people are hot and cold about, the worry that as a firm their business is dead in the long term, that they will forever be having to do the less profitable deliveries whilst TNT get the most lucrative ones, as they aren't having to deliver to remote areas.  Meanwhile they have a union that isn't the most understanding about change and the like.

Obviously humour is subjective, and I'm *definitely* not saying Clarkson should be branded a racist and thrown from the BBC studios - I think this whole media shit-storm and headhunt is absolutely ridiculous.

It's humour because of the context of the nursery rhyme, not because of the word which he doesn't in fact enunciate.

&gt;You honestly can't see how 'catch a nigger by his toe', even hinted at, could be intensely offensive to some?

I can see how anything Clarkson says, being an elderly white man who isn't utterly apologizing for his existence and culture, would be offensive to some ivory tower political broilers.

In 1856, a local nurseryman, Henry Merryweather asked if he could take cuttings from the tree and start to sell the apples. Bramley agreed but insisted that the apples should bear his name.""

The outrage is about an *un-aired* recital of a nursery rhyme that included a glossed over, mumbled/obfuscated form of the word 'nigger'.

When I first came across a headline about this, I thought this was another case of Clarkson's schoolboy antics and him gleefully getting to say - or alluding to - a ""forbidden"" word by way of using reported speech in the form of an old nursery rhyme. That would've been tasteless and puerile, but even then I would've been hard pressed to accept that Clarkson was ""legitimizing racism"" and accidentally revealed his rampant hatred of minorities and all that jazz. What seems to have gotten people's panties in a twist is not even that. **edit** Actually, I don't know the full context of the clip and some have said that the clip was indeed a comment about ""political correctness"" infringing upon nursery rhymes. 

Clarkson and the Top Gear writing team has played to racist sterotypes for years for 'shock value'. The problem with this kind of ironic ambivalence (when saying horrible things about the French, Germans, vegetarians etc.) is that some take the comments at face value (""it's funny because it's true""). With Top Gear, that segment of the audience is not insignificant.

As some have commented, Clarkson's apology is bizarre and it is easy to read ironic undertones to him ""begging for forvigeness"" over an unaired, glossed over, mumbled word that had to be analyzed by forensic experts. He's literally not using the word to refer to anyone, or even making a point about saying it.

This is, in a purely rational sense, entirely true, but it's also the exact rationale behind ""Life Unworthy of Life"" (Lebensunwertes Leben) - and the euthanising of those people for the good of themselves and everyone else.

You're correct that there's an element of moral cowardice in simply shying away from the whole discussion and declaring that 'life is sacred,' but irrespective of puffery about 'absolute right to life' we can't escape the fact that post-partum 'euthanising' is really just murder.

It's perfectly true that lots of people, when asked, would rather end themselves than live with a really serious (and here we mean something like Treacher-Collins or Lesch-Nyhan) disability - but everyone you ask will be comparing it with their unafflicted life. We can look at the quality of life of someone with some major disability and decide that it's frankly shit - *in comparison to ours.*

People suffering from those conditions don't have that benchmark, their state of being is the only one they will ever have. Moreover, straying perilously close to that sanctity of life flummery I said I'd avoid, their *existence* is the only one they'll ever have.

I wouldn't for a moment begrudge someone in that condition their own choice to end their life, nor would I begrudge a pregnant woman the right to abort a foetus with one of these conditions. After birth though, I am supremely wary of anyone who wants to start killing people off 'for their own good' - again, you might be correct that this is simply moral cowardice, but when you arrogate the power to decide who should live and who should die, you cross a line we spent a very long time and an incalculable volume of blood drawing in the first place.",0,1399129578,null,0,false,0,ch8jgdj,t3_24lxxc,t1_ch8jgdj,t1_ch8gb0k,null,1433633275,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

That seems unnecessary. I've refrained from making generalisations and judgements about you (though the 'closet racist Top Gear' jabs are such low-hanging fruit). My skin colour and yours has no bearing on my point. 

&gt; Your culture and heritage is globalized at this point and in ten years time you'll be a racist for claiming otherwise the way your country's offense culture is flourishing.

Ah, the motto of the 'anti-PC' crowd. If the ability to say 'nigger' is really such a great marker of cultural identity to you, I frankly welcome the day that culture disappears. I'm intensely proud of my heritage as a Britain - that's not just the reserve of racists and anti-establishment types. 

&gt; you take offense at humour you ""don't find funny""

No, I don't. I take offense at humour I think is offensive. 

&gt; The issue here being that you did not recognize it as a joke

You're wrong there. I just disagree that the premise is an acceptable cause for humour. ""But the use of 'nigger' here isn't a central part of any comedic point"" was my original point, and by that I meant - it's not used in an ironic or way meant to critique it's use or anything of the sort. It's just used as a 'naughty' word to stir up antagonism. I do no think that's an acceptable use in public discourse. I am not saying race, ethnicity, religion are not acceptable topics for humour. I am not saying you can't say 'nigger' in any circumstances. I am saying, if you use emotive language with little thought to its impact, you have to rightly expect criticism and debate. I think this is a very positive thing, and speaks to the fact that our public life is far more concerned with including as many different people as possible.

P.S just to rebut this snidey little point: 
&gt; That's funny, since mumbling is the very opposite of explicit language.

By all means do. I certainly wouldn't mind teaching a suburban brit from an ethnically homogeneous area like Wiltshire a thing or two about racism.

&gt;Ah, the motto of the 'anti-PC' crowd. 

Thankfully there's no such thing as ""PC"" here and people would laugh at you for trying to silence them over non-issues. In your country there is, and quite blatantly so when the average Top Gear comment becomes a minor media-driven scandal every other week.

&gt;If the ability to say 'nigger' 

This is great. Ironizing over the cleaning-up of formerly offensive phrases is the same as complaining about the ability to say racial slurs according to you. Way to continue admitting you didn't get the core of the joke in the first place.

&gt;I frankly welcome the day that culture disappears. I'm intensely proud of my heritage as a Britain 

Oh but of course you are. That's why you take issue with people well-known for not being ashamed of it.

&gt;You're wrong there. I just disagree that the premise is an acceptable cause for humour. 

In your very own words ""but the use of a word in a non-ironic way that many find incredibly offensive."" 

An admission that you did not recognize the irony at all, and a claim of ""many"" finding it incredibly offensive on top of that. 

&gt;and speaks to the fact that our public life is far more concerned with including as many different people as possible.

What a joke. This is the exact opposite of including those people, it's patronizing them to the point of claiming agency in their name, and pushing on them an easily offended image of your own making. 

There are enough real issues with racism without you suburban brats co-opting minority people's voice for your own political ideals.

true,beejiu,eng-essex,Essex,"&gt; So why do I think it was good? Because there's no up-front need to pay, and the threshold before you start paying back is so high (£21k), it's the grads who have gained from university and are now earning more than most people who are the ones who pay the most. For many under the new system, they won't pay a penny and won't have tuition fee debt at all.

I don't understand this. I'm fortunate to have a 2010 loan, and I don't pay back until I earn £17k per year. So that's only a 'saving' of £360 per year, but I'd rather pay an extra £360 *now* if my loan is only £3500 pa rather than £9000 pa. Besides, £21k is the average starting salary, so most graduates are over the limit from day 1, and will be well over by the time they are 30 years old. I think the far majority of people will end up paying the loan off.

Also, my current interest rate is 1.5% (**£210 pa**) compared to 6.3% under the new system (**£882 pa**).

I'm fairly sure that I am better off with a 2010 loan than under the new system.

And if we were discussing aborting foetuses before the development of a fully functioning nervous system we'd be in perfect accord. The problem arises in your presumption that newborn aren't sentient. 

It's correct that people don't remember being born - the few people who claim otherwise are generally mistaken - the phenomenon is called [Childhood Amnesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_amnesia) and I remember being bored to tears studying it way back when, but it's absolutely **not** correct to infer from this that infants are not sentient.

Biochemically, it's the greatest 'shock' you will ever experience, and it's now generally considered the point at which conscious awareness begins.

'The time to deal with such disabilities,' presuming we're discussing termination, is therefore before birth. I've stated and will repeat I have no ethical concerns about anyone electing to terminate a foetus with this sort of condition.

My brother and his old flatmates who were of different races, casually called each other racial slurs all the time (nigger, Paki etc).

I get the feeling the outrage is primarily coming from overly sensitive middle-class white liberals who patronisingly think that black people are precious little buttercups who've never been insulted in their lives and can't handle [being offended.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHMoDt3nSHs#t=203)

[It reminds me a little bit of this story about a black English guy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1seelc/black_people_of_reddit_who_have_spent_time_in/cdwxn9h) Not so much whether ""nigger"" is equivalent to those terms, but how white middle class liberals who (lets face it) don't have much to care about, will take it upon themselves to be ""offended"" on behalf of the victim(s), regardless of whether or not the victim(s) think it's offensive or even care whether it is.

That being said, as much as I like Top Gear and Clarkson (despite all his faults), I think he should probably resign with grace. As Clarkson said (in regards to the BBC giving him a final warning):

&gt; ""And even the angel Gabriel would struggle to survive with that hanging over his head. It's inevitable that one day, someone, somewhere will say that I've offended them, and that will be that.""

The last thing that should happen is Top Gear turning into another bland, politically correct and rather boring TV show like 'The One Show', except about automotive's.

I don't like Sherwood and will be glad to see the back of him, but I don't think either option was any good really.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I wouldn't have expected the youth in the league, but we were still using 1st team players in the cups.  In the game against FC North Pole we were bringing 1st team players into the match as subs, the only time we saw any youth was the 2nd half against the last place team in Russia with the match well in hand.

The Baldini/AVB rift is truly bizarre, AVB wanted us to bring in Baldini and when he came in there was a great deal of talk about how AVB trusted Baldini's judgement....we brought in 3 players that AVB wanted or signed off on (Soldado, Paulinho, Lamela) and tried for 2 more (David Villa, Willian) who chose to go elsewhere despite our offers. We brought in Eriksen, Chadli and Vlad as alternatives which weren't exactly poor choices.  Remember we also got rid of players for AVB (Caulker, Thudd, BAE) and tried to move Ade for him (offer from Turkey that Ade turned down).....If AVB was truly upset with the moves we made then he was less flexible than we all thought.

I didn't have a huge issue with Ade being sent to the reserves, however when the team was struggling to score and Ade made amends (including standing in front of the first team and apologizing) i wonder why AVB was unwilling to at least try Ade and see if we could get some spark. We were having the same issues this season creating scoring chances that we did last season, however last season those issues were masked by Bale's individual brilliance....we can say that time would have improved things, but in 18 months we still showed the same glaring issues when it came to creating chances to score.

I genuinely liked AVB and i think he will go on to be a solid manager, but it just sounded like this relationships within the club were completely falling apart, the stress was really starting to show and it looked like AVB was starting to wear out.  

I really think that AVB's departure was the equivalent of a marriage falling apart. The sacking was probably for the best for all parties concerned.

We'll try and claim it for Lambert, but it may well have already been in, either way we didn't particularly deserve the win, but definitely didn't deserve a loss either, and probably played a bit better, we controlled the game away from him against the other team that has extremely high possession. And to be honest, it feels good to have that late goal win us a game, it's happened quite often against us so nice change.

As for the match, I didn't expect much and it didn't fail to meet expectations there. Some players look a bit tired, Gallagher looks like he needs a loan spell to get used to throwing his weight around, holding the ball up and especially putting it in the back of the net when given the chance. Everyone else just looks a bit lackadaisical without someone like Rodriguez to try to put through, or to run through a player or two. Just miss the pace.

Kind of dreading United next week, would dearly like to get one over on them but I don't see it happening, even if they just lost to Sunderland, I can't see us threatening enough.

Maybe just throw a couple of other youths in there, get a run out, see what it's really like and what they've got, Reed getting more time and maybe Sims coming in could be interesting. Hell I'd take Seager up front, think he's got a bit of pace behind him, who knows. I'd love to beat them though, repay them for sending us down, show off how far we've come and how far they've fallen. We'll see I guess, always the chance of scoring whatever the match, even if it never looked likely... today's match a perfect example...

Mash the potatoes with some butter, an egg yolk, salt and pepper and cheese. I like a nice hard cheese like a pecorino or a provolone(stops the mash being too wet). If you're still a ways off with your sauce then just keep the mash hot with some cling film.


Drain the fish while keeping the cooking liquor. Make a sauce by ladling the liquor gradually over a roux so it's smooth and creamy. As it's cooking out(to remove the floury taste, add some chopped chives and parsley.

Then put your blanched fish into a pie dish with just enough sauce to barely cover it(too much and it will come up over the sides when you put the mash on.

Pipe or smooth the mash on top and sprinkle a bit more cheese on top then bake at 180 until golden brown. If you like a bit of a crust on top then sprinkle some breadcrumbs over with the extra cheese.

As long as unionist transfer their votes down the ballot papers enough it shouldn't cause a problem.

Also, interesting point on the TUV affect on the vote in 2009: if you look at how the votes transferred after Allister was eliminated, you can see that ~40,000 votes went to the UCU-NF, with only ~25,000 votes going to the DUP. So the DUP wouldn't have made quota on the first count anyway.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qinetiq#Stock_exchange_listing

&gt;The flotation of the company has been dogged with controversy. Ennobled in 2005, Lord Moonie, who handled the initial sale, said in 2006 that the government's 31 per cent stake should not have been sold when equity markets were languishing in 2002. He said that he had argued for the sale to be delayed but was overruled by the Treasury, which had convinced the Ministry of Defence to go ahead.

&gt;Qinetiq was floated on the London Stock Exchange in February 2006. The company had been valued at between £1.1bn and £1.3bn, with the MoD holding estimated to be worth £616m – £728m, the Carlyle Group's holding £341m – £403m, and staff/management's holding worth £143m – £169m. Controversy was generated by the very large returns for the Carlyle Group and senior managers, with figures of over £20m suggested in the media for Sir John Chisholm.

&gt;Financial press speculation concerning a stock exchange float increased in January 2006. On 12 January 2006 an announcement was made in parliament by Dr John Reid, Secretary of State for Defence. He said that the Carlyle Group 'will continue to retain a significant stake in the company', and that the government would continue to hold a 'Golden Share' to protect the UK's security and defence interests.

&gt;Controversy also arose around the fact that retail investors were excluded from the initial public offering (IPO) due to Qinetiq's complexity and that institutional investors would require less complicated marketing and financing. This led to contrasts with the 'Sid' campaign for British Gas plc in 1986, where retail investors were encouraged to buy shares, with discounts and a large advertising campaign. The issue was partially resolved by allowing some brokerage firms to place orders in the IPO as part of a combined order, allowing the firm to purchase as though an institutional investor but on behalf of clients. While this did not result in a public campaign or retail investor discounts, it did allow many investors to purchase shares. The company floated on 10 February 2006, with an IPO of 200p per share, which gave a market value of £1.3bn. On 13 February 2006 (the Monday after the Friday IPO) shares closed at 219.5p, valuing the company at over £1.4bn.

&gt;Speculation that a consortium including Qinetiq was about to win a £10bn MoD training contract helped push their share price back above 190p in early November 2006. It was announced on 17 January 2007 that the Qinetiq-led Metrix consortium was the preferred bidder for package one of the MoD's Defence Training Rationalisation programme, worth approx £16bn.

&gt;NAO inquiry

&gt;In 2007, the National Audit Office conducted an inquiry into the privatisation to determine whether UK taxpayers got good value for money. The inquiry looked at the following issues:

&gt;choice of privatisation strategy;

&gt;management of the process (the split of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency into two, the sale to Carlyle and the flotation);

&gt;costs incurred and the proceeds achieved; and

&gt;whether the deal met its objectives.

&gt;In November 2007, the NAO reported that taxpayers could have gained ""tens of millions"" more and was critical of the incentive scheme given to Qinetiq managers, the 10 most senior of whom gained £107.5m on an investment of £540,000 in the company's shares. The ***return of 19,990%*** was described as ""excessive"" by the NAO. The role of Qinetiq's management in negotiating terms with the Carlyle Group while the private equity company was bidding for the business was also criticised by the NAO. Carlyle bought a third of the business for £42m, which grew in value to £372m in less than four years. However, the Ministry of Defence defended the sale:

&gt;""It has delivered excellent value for money, generating more than £800m for the taxpayer, while protecting UK defence and security interests,"" said Baroness Taylor, Minister for Defence Equipment and Support.

2. I don't think the NHS has particularly changed either. And surely the biggest steps to privatisation was the last government letting private companies literally own hospitals and rent them back to the NHS? I've seen a lot of moaning but little evidence of actual privatisation.

3. Agreed with this.

4. Not a bad idea. Badly implemented though.

5. Welfare cap is a good idea. Somebody getting £26,000+ of government money is not the poorest in society. And your comment about corporate welfare is too generic. Are you talking about the bailouts?

6. Evidence? I did a quick google and we've had privately run prisons since the early 1990's. There are 14 in the UK (http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/hmps/contracted-out). I had a quick look at some of their websites and many opened in the 90's and early 2000's. They're not a Tory creation.

7. Hasn't affected me at all. I doubt it has affected you either.

8. Don't know too much about this

9. Fracking has been used in the UK since the 80's, and the new stuff hasn't started yet. But we have discovered a potential motherload of shale gas under the UK. Wouldn't we be crazy not to sell/use it? 

10. Again, a vague and unsubstantiated point. 

And as a general point, privatisation isn't inherently bad. We should look at outcomes not ideologies. Who gives a shit whether businesses or government runs schools, or hospitals or prisons? Lets worry about the quality of the education, healthcare or rehabilitation instead of who runs it. I also find it funny how people are so against privatisation also complain the loudest about government. 

Seems like you've been reading too much of the Guardian and you're letting a strong anti-tory bias get the better of you. You expect privatisation and cuts from the government, so that's all you see.

true,Unlinkedhorizonzero,,Belfast,"The mindset of a Unionist politician is to have an Anglo-Protestant nation where the Union flag flies 365 days a year, free from Gays, free from their Irish Counterparts and a state police force that works for them and is entirely inclusive to the protestant people. People go to Church on a Sunday and abide by Christian teachings.


This trickles down into the lower classes and amasses hatred against the Irish even though the population here is nearly a Catholic majority. I live in West Belfast and I know what Working class is but the Non -Educated/Working Class from the Protestant side make the Catholic working class look like Lords and Dukes. It is filled with bitterness and hatred and spite for a people that they probably work with + walk past on a daily basis and is embroidered into them from a very young age. There used to be an old saying that ""The dirt on the bottom of your shoes was more important than a Catholic""


Because the PUL community is so heavily steeped within the Working class, Religion plays a major factor in their upbringing. There tends to be a belief in a divine aspect that labels the land they currently live on as theirs and theirs only which breeds hate.

This ideology youve put forward of ""them standing up for something they believe in"" is laughable ... Would you condemn me if I was protesting against Black/Asians being allowed in this country ? The sheer tenacity that they are even protesting in the first place is disgraceful and comparable to Neo-Nazi marches.


The values in a British society is Non-inclusive, Liberal and accepting, The people who proclaim they are British here don't abide to any of that. There is a reason why the English hate the Loyalist population here and are against political parties like UKIP.

Using coal makes us reliant on a resource we have plenty of in the UK; potential for more job creation in the UK rather than handing cash over to, and being cripplingly reliant upon, Russia.

Cutting subsidies for renewable energy isn't a bad thing in my opinion.

Investment in research, to get to the point that renewable is more profitable, seems a better use of public funds (technology which we could then sell to the world).

It presupposes that the KKK have lost support because easily offended people have policed our language and whined at every non-politically correct joke that's made it on to tv.  It also presupposes that most good things are done by empathic people.

Arguably, much of the moral progress that has been made is because of analytically minded intellectuals who have made serious arguments about how to improve life - rather than easily offended people who see racism in Disney cartoons.

We do it when Suarez is out wide or when Johnson gets on the overlap, and to a limited extent with Sterling, but it's not particularly often and we don't have a natural winger for it, especially with Sterling being more central these days.

Proper wingers aren't about just lumping crosses into the box and hoping that someone gets on the end of it. Proper wingers are about stretching the play, pulling defenders outside the box, and making it harder for teams to just shove five men in the middle of the penalty area to stop us getting through. They create space for the players in the middle as much as they create chances. 

Next season there are going to be so many teams trying to emulate what Chelsea did last week, because they'll see it as a proven way to keep a clean sheet against us and their best chance to pick-up points. We need a couple of decent wingers to change our style of play against teams who do that, because it's incredibly difficult to play directly through that kind of defensive system - you have to go round the outside and try and disrupt their shape, and get some dangerous balls across the six-yard box which can quite easily get bundled into the back of the net even with a packed penalty area.

It's not about changing the style of the team, it's about giving ourselves more flexibility in attack and the ability to adapt. If you can only play football one way, then all it takes is for a couple of teams to figure out how to beat you and once it catches on you're stuffed.

I'm not really sure where I am going with this, but she lived for column inches and so column inches will be generated on her death, they use an image which she herself/pr company pushed into the public eye the mail produce there usual shit and use her own image in the piece.

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"The general rule is a maximum of 1/3rd of your take home spent on rent, if you use that figure then you'll be able to afford all of your bills and have money to save at the end of the month. If you start going above 1/3rd on rent you start squeezing yourself elsewhere and set yourself up for financial problems. A lot of letting agents use 30 x rent as the figure for affordability, so if you want to rent somewhere for £500 per month you must earn at least £15,000 per year. Spend around £500 per month on rent and you'll be a-okay. Remember that you also need to put money towards an emergency fund (if you don't already have one).

To start a rental you'll need money for fees (~£200 is a good estimate), the first months rent and the deposit (which is normally equal to 1.5 months rent). That means if you're renting a place for £500 per month you'll need around £1450 upfront (and assuming you don't cause any damage you'll get £750 back at the end).

If you're looking for general advice: take saving and budgeting seriously, they are **mandatory** if you want to give yourself a good start in life. I know people earning much more than you who have left home and within months started accruing debt on credit cards because they thought it was okay to spend every penny that they earned, then when surprise bills come (which they will) they have to start depending on credit to get by and it doesn't get better, once you're in the credit hole it's very difficult to get out because you have to start making sacrifices and people aren't good at that. I love the [YNAB](http://youneedabudget.com) method of budgeting, if you can commit to their program (read up on their ""method"") you'll set yourself up for a very good life.

1. Budget
2. Save for retirement (if your employer offers a pension **join it** and get the full match)
3. Save for an emergency fund as a priority (3 months minimum, 6 months is best)
4. Save *first* before spending money, you get paid £1500 a month, put £x (maybe £300) into a savings account at the start of the month, then don't touch it ever.

If you save 40% of your income you could retire by 40. If you save nothing you'll have to work until you die at 90. You need to save at least 20% of your income if you want any chance at a reasonable retirement, and remember thanks to the wonder of compound interest the earlier you save the more impact it will have, don't think ""eh I'll start saving when I'm 30!"".",0,1399139738,null,0,1399140560,0,ch8nago,t3_24m1n0,t1_ch8nago,t3_24m1n0,null,1433635082,9,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,9

true,ShanghaiNoon,null,null,"&gt;I'm not claiming that it is unique, thought I don't remember any other party coming out with this position, just that it is a Ukip policy which is sensible. Building more coal is a good idea; modern coal is not as polluting as old coal stations (still not ideal I realise) and, from what I understand, we need something to provide us with quick bursts of power. Currently we use gas for this; which makes us reliant on imports from Russia. Using coal makes us reliant on a resource we have plenty of in the UK; potential for more job creation in the UK rather than handing cash over to, and being cripplingly reliant upon, Russia.

Britain isn't Germany, it's not ""crippingly reliant"" on Russia. Coal is obviously cleaner than it was several decades ago (as is every form of energy) but is still far more polluting and dangerous than other forms of energy - including nuclear. UKIP's position on building nuclear plants is hardly unique, it's currently being implemented under the coalition government and it's only the Greens who oppose it. 

&gt;Cutting subsidies for renewable energy isn't a bad thing in my opinion. Ideally our renewable generation would be higher, the way to achieve this should, I think, not be by the government handing over cash to energy companies. Investment in research, to get to the point that renewable is more profitable, seems a better use of public funds (technology which we could then sell to the world).

That's not the way subsidises work, money isn't being handed over to energy companies, they are forced to find cleaner ways of providing energy through carbon limits. The carbon trading scheme encourages energy companies to use less polluting forms of energy and investment in renewables isn't taxed the same way fossil fuels are. UKIP oppose this and would like to see the UK return to using greater levels of fossil fuels, especially coal which is far worse than LPG or oil.

&gt;Anyhow I'm no Ukip fan, just giving an example of a policy which to me seems sensible.

If you're talking about UKIP's energy policy generally, then it's not a very sensible one. Unless you think all three mainstream parties have a worse energy policy it's no reason to prefer UKIP's. On nuclear energy, UKIP have nothing which sets them apart from the mainstream parties so that's not a reason to prefer UKIP on this particular issue either. 

The only reason to support UKIP in this area is if you support greater use of highly polluting forms of energy like coal and oppose investment in renewables or in newer, less polluting forms of energy.",0,1399140400,null,0,false,0,ch8nju7,t3_24lxxc,t1_ch8nju7,t1_ch8mlqj,null,1433635205,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"My old bulk-cook staple when I was a student was special fried rice.

* Rice for 6 people (about 40p, depending where I bought it and in what quantity)

* 1 large onion (about 25p)

* whatever stir-fryable veggies are going cheap (£1-2) If you can get the pack that's got mange-tout and minicorn in together for £1 that's a good deal. Beansprouts work too, but tend to come in huge bags for £1. Spring onions if they're cheap enough, but be careful with these, since you've got to top and tail them and only keep three quarters of the vegetable by weight. And spinach is a good idea too, it comes in bulky big bags but once it's in the stir fry it goes small quickly and it's good for you so yeah. Peppers work well in here, too, and add a bit of colour and flavour. I've tried it with carrots and it doesn't work, so don't use carrots.

* peas out the freezer (about 15p)

* pine nuts (a bag costs about £2.25, and I'd use maybe 20% of the bag for 6 portions, so 45p)

* 3 eggs (about 50p)

* a fair splash of soy sauce (a small bottle now costs about £1.20, so probably about 10p worth)

* and if I could afford it 4 rashers of bacon (about £2 if you get a pack of 4 rashers, less if you buy a pack of 8)

All that costs about £4.85-5.85 for 6 portions, though you've got to buy some of those ingredients in larger quantities, but then you've got stuff left over afterwards for further cooking, or next time. Also works with noodles. What I do for noodles is, if the Sharwoods dry noodles that come in packs of 8 are on offer, I'll get them. They keep forever and boil in about 3 minutes. Bit more expensive than getting store brand crap (Asda had them for 8p a pack when I was in first year) but so much tastier.

Anyway. You can make a good healthy bulk special fried rice dish, with plenty of veggies and even some meat, for under £1 per portion. I've got a basic version in the freezer right now (onions, spring onions, peas and pine nuts, but no bacon and no soy sauce). I definitely recommend including soy sauce. From onions to eggs in my list, add in that order. Add bacon after onions if you're using it, and once the rice is done add that after the eggs, then the soy sauce, and mix it all up. I cook it all in a large saucepan - the kind with a handle on either side - rather than a wok because I don't have a wok and because it means you can really mix it up properly.",0,1399140466,null,0,false,0,ch8nkrs,t3_24m6k4,t1_ch8nkrs,t1_ch8iqma,null,1433635218,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

&gt;PSNI investigation and Boston College tapes

&gt;In August 2006, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Sir Hugh Orde, said he was not hopeful that anyone would be brought to account over the murder, saying that ""[in] any case of that age, it is highly unlikely that a successful prosecution could be mounted.""

&gt;Boston College had launched an oral history project on the Troubles in 2001. It recorded interviews with republicans and loyalists about their involvement in the conflict, on the understanding that the tapes would not be released until after their deaths. Two of the republican interviewees, Brendan Hughes and Dolours Price, said they were involved in McConville's kidnapping. Both were opposed to the Good Friday Agreement and Sinn Féin's support of it but they were not dissident republicans in the sense that they did not advocate a return to political violence. In particular, they saw Gerry Adams as a traitor for negotiating the Agreement and persuading the IRA to end its campaign. In 2010, after Hughes's death, some of his statements were published in the book Voices from the Grave. He claimed that McConville had admitted being an informer, and that Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams was involved in her disappearance. In February 2010, according to an article published in the Sunday Life, Price claimed that Adams had ordered her to take McConville to be killed. The article made it seem like the journalist had had access to the interviews given to the Boston College, which has been strenuously denied by Ed Moloney. Price said she gave the interviews as revenge against Adams. She died in 2013. Adams has denied any role in the death of McConville.

&gt;In 2011, the PSNI began a legal bid to gain access to the tapes. Acting on a request from the PSNI, the United States Justice Department has tried to legally force Boston College to hand them over. This legal dispute sparked a debate about journalistic freedom, as Boston College promised those interviewed that the tapes would not be released until after their deaths. Other interviewees said they feared retribution if the tapes were released. Following a lengthy court battle, the PSNI was given transcripts of interviews by Hughes and Price.

We can offer as much advice as we can about how to keep safe, but at the end of the day if your house is on fire and the fire service is on strike, there possibly wont be anyone there to put it out in a timely manner. Someone will turn up at some point, because the fire authority has a legal responsibility to, but for example in Derbyshire, there were 4(ish) fire engines available today, as opposed to the usual 40(ish), so response times are going to take a hit, I also know how well trained these 'reserve' firefighters are, and wouldn't particulay want to be working with them on a real incident, but once I walk out the doors, I suppose I lose the right to tell my replacements what they should be doing.

There are people out there that say we shouldn't be allowed to, and to be honest, I wouldn't argue with them, as it's a perfectly valid opinion, that I just happen to disagree with.

It's an argument with the government, and unfortunately the only way to make a point to a government who refuse to negotiate, talk, or even acknowledge there is a problem, is to lawfully withdraw ones labour.

The next question is usually ""How do you justify it to yourself?"" which will be a different answer depending on who you speak to. I am contracted to give cover for 120 hours per week. Minus the combined 22 hours that I will have been on strike for this Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and the 3 hours that I am taking my girlfriend out for on Sunday, I will have given 143 hours cover for the week. That, and I happen to believe that the damage that this government is doing to the fire service will cause much more damage and danger to people (both fire service staff and members of the public) and property in the long run, than a few hours striking here and there will.

That's probably a bit heavier of an answer than a thread about what everyone is having for dinner deserves. I left the picket line and went home for some beans on toast at about 1830.

Funny you should mention context.

Further, 'eenie meanie, minie, moe, catch a nigger by his toe, if he squeels let him go, eenie meenie minie moe' also has an historical context - the thing called the slave trade. That was where black people - or 'niggers' - were taken against their will on a journey a good deal wouldn't survive to provide free labour, usually under less-than-ideal conditions.

What people in this thread don't understand is you can't remove a word from its historical context, and continuing to use it holds the same stigmas today as it did two centuries ago.

The gov.uk website is excellent and they seem to be constantly driving home the need to have a good tech strategy with a focus on cutting waste and getting best value for money.

The most important element of this is being more proactive about procurement. This is a huge change for the UK government, a lot of IT spending goes big IT integrators like ATOS, IBM, Fujitsu, Siemens, Accenture and inevitably most of it goes down the drain.

Nationalism in my opinion is more progressive and has much more competent politicians. Also a major point for me is the fact that nationalisn is open to anyone, it doesn't discriminate against protestants. I am a nationalist, though I'm quite happy being an Irish person who has UK citizenship.  It can seem at times that unionism is just flat out hibernophobic. Also it perplexes me how some people under the label of unionism/loyalism are fanatically intent on expressing their 'britishness' while being so different compared to their mainland counterparts.

I'm glad a moderate Unionist party is breaking on to the scene, and I hope they do really well in the Assembly elections in 2016, I might even vote for them if they're running a candidate in Foyle, but for now, mainstream Unionism is detestable.

1) Away match

2) Both sides were dangerous in the opening 20-25 minutes. There was no clear favorite. I would've said Spurs were the better side. I'm obviously biased.

3) As soon as Kaboul is sent off, West Ham pressed. And pressed. And pressed. And limited every bit of space so we had nowhere to go. Granted, there was a period of 20 minutes or so in the 2nd half where Eriksen wasn't closed down at all, but West Ham sought out to exploit the fact that we were down a man.

I agree with you that Sherwood's player selection seems to be a bit odd and that he's clearly not the manager we need, but you have to remember that he *is* and interim manager. I see Sherwood with these three traits: **low tactical knowledge, low player knowledge, great motivator.** The first one is just a clear weakness. The second he can't help because he hasn't had enough time with the squad to develop enough knowledge (see: ""much of a muchness"" quote, can't separate the good players in the side other than the obvious elite players) and the third one is his great strength. Spurs have earned points under Sherwood for one of two reasons: sheer talent outweighing the opposition or having come back from a losing position because of Sherwood's motivational tactics.

I understand why people hate Sherwood so much. I'm here to say it's not a good enough reason. Basically, we've asked for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and we've been handed tuna. It's great tuna, kalamata olives, chopped onions, night weight to the meat, but it's not what we want. We still take a bite telling ourselves it's peanut butter and jelly, but the bizarre contrast between the two sandwiches makes it worse.

That's fine! That's why I'm here to argue with you, because I want to know exactly why you think they shouldn't be in civilian hands. 

&gt;ex-forces &amp; experience 

Some ex-military and ex-police guys have a very different view about guns than those who have never been in either of those two. 

Before I give an example, let me start by saying, military and civilians with conceal carry permits require two completely different types of training. A civilian with a CHL needs to know the law when it comes to the legality of displaying the weapon and picking the best fitting gun for their body (concealment) and hand (action type/grip size/angle). A big difference in training revolves around that a CHL holder does not go into a dangerous situation, unlike military and police, who are trained to do exactly that. Instead, a CHL holder reacts to a situation that's thrust upon them. Another difference is, a CHL holder uses concealment to hide the fact he or she has a gun until the moment is right, which is a big part of self defense with a CHL permit. Military and police mostly open carry, with some exceptions, and are are trained to defend and attack in many types of situations. Again, this is in general. Some infantry in the past have been only taught to fight, breach, and build muscle. I'm not an expert on every kind of police and military jobs or divisions. I just know that there are different types of opportunities and training in each. 

Let me give you some examples, as promised at the beginning of this wall of text. 

It's really common in the U.S. for ex military types to try and teach civilians here how to defend themselves using some of their past experiences, which risks not being applicable. I heard Iraqveteran8888 from youtube actually say we should keep a semi-auto AK-47 with loaded 4 mags in our cars just in case ""shit breaks out"" which is the dumbest thing I've ever heard anyone tell me as a gun enthusiast. I mean I understand buying a gun because you like it, but pretending ninjas are going to attack is stupid. I've also seen James Yeager's (youtube star who is an ex-cop and ex-military) collection of semi-auto AR-15s, that fills a room, all for just in case ""shit breaks out"". So when you give me your gun experience in the military, let me just say, you might know how to field-strip a tank and jump out of a helicopter, but that training has little overlap with CHL training, law, and purpose.

6 million for Butland and defender covered by sales, Barry and Fernando on frees, 20million for the 2 strikers should do us quite nicely...

true,PhantomLord666,null,null,"&gt;  The photo i think must have been taken not far from Great Gable.

Bang on. I've been up there enough to say I'm at least 90% sure you're right.

The side of Kirkfell is on the near-right, meaning just off picture in the bottom right is Beckhead, and the picture is taken just off the summit of Great Gable. Whinrigg on the left side of the lake, Seat Allen on the right. And that buttress cliff is Ling Mell Nose which does indeed lead straight up to Scafell Pike.

There's 2 big fell races around here - the Horseshoe and the Scafell up-and-down.

Horseshoe route: set off at the near end of the lake, run along the screes and up onto Whinrigg. Down across the far end of the lake and up Seat Allen, onto Pillar which is behind Kirkfell, across the back of Kirkfell on the other side. Then up past the photographer onto Great Gable, down to Esk Hause between Gable and Scafell, up onto Scafell Pike and down Ling Mell Nose.    
22 miles, with something like 9000 feet of ascent. Last years winner did it in under 4 hours. And the front runners get up onto Great Gable, which is something like 18 miles into the race, and look like they're out for a stroll in the park. They're  unbelievably fit.

Scafell-up-and-down: set off at near end of the lake, straight up Ling Mell Nose, onto Scafell Pike, turn round and run down.    
3000 feet of ascent, and about 2 miles. The record for this one is 49 minutes. 33 minutes going up, 16 back down...    
Last year, the winner cycled 40 miles there, ran the race and decided he enjoyed it so much he'd run up and down again - *and overtook the last runners in the race on the way down* - and cycled home.

The fact that the press spends ridiculous amounts of time covering non-stories like this is absolutely mind boggling considering nobody that matters gives a flying shit about it. 

You'll notice that my question was about what concerns them the most, nowhere did I say that a person can only care about one issue. Clearly, institutional racism ranks far higher on most peoples minds than a slip of the tongue from Clarkson.

It's press laziness at its best. They want to expose racism because it's popular with the readers and elicits large amounts of outrage, but they have 2 choices: Either expose some gaffe from a comedian by stealing a tape, or do REAL INVESTIGATIVE journalism to uncover institutional racism in law enforcement, judiciary, hiring, government service provision, etc. Naturally many journalists pick the low-effort option, contributing to the dumbing down of the media.

I didn't see the episode where he said the ""N"" word but I can tell you that the reason it's a big deal here is that until the 1970's it was a common insult to black people and used all over the US very nonchalantly. That changed with civil rights and by the 1970's it became associated more with ignorance and it was no longer an accepted word. The same as the word Negro is no longer used in the US, even though I still hear older people say Negro it's not accepted and associated with racism. In effect it's better to err on the part of caution and not say any ""N"" words in association with Black people. 

The root of the ""N"" word is actually from German where it is used as an adjective describing someone who is black. It is also from what I understand a word they no longer say in Germany as well.

In America we don't even spell out the ""N' word just because of how upset it makes people both black and white when people say it.

Politics isn't a binary choice between hanging gay people and thought-policing individuals...

It's a wide spectrum, trying to paint it as some binary choice is political cowardice for the lazy. It's like painting economic policy as a choice between open borders/trade and a state communist closed borders system. We can and should be wary of sliding too far to either side. 

Just as the white supremacists should be shown the door, we should also show the door to the radicals on the other end of the spectrum, those that use the tabloid press to instigate witch hunts on people they don't like, those that violently and disruptively interfere with legitimate lectures and discussions. Those that could turn our country into a shithole of lawsuits, false-outrage, paranoia and over protective parenting. 

They might be more ""fluffy"" and less physically dangerous, but the political influence they can have is similar. Read: These people can still negatively impact peoples lives, witch hunts can cost people their jobs, their children, their reputation. The actions of SJW's are not harmless. At all.

We need to make it clear to them that they are not taken seriously, and the press should not be giving them a platform to spout rubbish for the sake of easy sales. That doesn't mean we suddenly go back to throwing gay people in jail. It means we fuck the nutcases off and focus on real issues that deserve significant press coverage.

What Jeremy Clarkson and the vast majority of people do however is lazy, they make jokes that come down to 'haha rape', or 'haha nigger' without any of the subtle quality that makes good humour. If you watch Ricky Gervais, Al Murray et al then they make that type of humour too. They however add extra qualities that elevate the joke and make you question whether you should really be laughing at it.

It seems like there are two camps. Those that do think he said nigger, but don't think it's a big deal, and those who deny him saying it at all.

For those in the first, show me a typical job where you can use that sort of language publicly and not get fired for it. It's an old nursery rhyme, he's from a different time, whatever. He's operating in this time now, and you can be damn sure if a lecturer, politician, or even standard employee was caught using that language in public, it would be considered unacceptable. We live in a society that's supposed to be better than this.

As for those who say he didn't at all, well, maybe you're right, but I for one find that hard to believe. He said something which, especially given its context, sounded like and is a stretch to interpret as anything other than the word nigger. The fact that it was mumbled but distinguishable does not excuse him, and only highlights the fact that, if he was saying something he felt was ok to say, he wouldn't have felt the need to mumble at all. I say it doesn't excuse him, because in no other context is doing something like that considered excusable. You wouldn't dare go up to your boss and mumble the word 'cunt' at them if there was even a remote possibility they'd be able to distinguish it, and if you did, and they could, they would be entirely justified in holding you accountable.

So, whether or not the backlash is totally in proportion, it's seems undeniable to me that he behaved unprofessionally, and is entirely accountable for that. I find the fact that so many people are arguing that he has done nothing wrong genuinely troubling.

Most of us are not racist, not because it's impossible to find racist material, but because racist arguments have gradually lost out to non-racist arguments over the course of the decades (and centuries).  

There could be 100 racist subreddits and I bet it wouldn't make you even slightly more racist - so why do you think it works differently for other people?

Oh, I'll just have to link to my favorite article again:  [The Case for Hate Speech](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/the-case-for-hate-speech/309524/)

I would also very much like you to consider watching this short video by academics Steve Pinker and Rebecca Goldstein on [The Long Reach of Reason](https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_and_rebecca_newberger_goldstein_the_long_reach_of_reason).

Pinker has devoted a lot of time to studying the phenomenon of moral progress, which has been generating a lot of interest in academic circles as of late.  Why is it that racism, homophobia and general nastiness seems to be declining over the centuries?  In the video, the philosopher Rebecca Goldstein supplies a fascinating and plausible answer to the question.

This is an interesting and important topic!  And the answers are anything but intuitive.  

Intuitively, many people might expect that improvements are made through using deterrents to punish bad speech.  For instance - banning Top Gear would remove Clarkson's offensive jokes from the air and SRS's bullying acts to punish racist speech.  But, I think that's wrong.  Moral progress has *not* come about through punishment, but through *reason*.  Free speech open societies are not spreading lies and bigotry - rather they're giving good arguments a chance to beat out the bad.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"That's a really good question. However I'm going to modify it in two important ways. First lets introduce (as you have) the idea of ""future morality"" - so let's say in the future morals change. Secondly, let's introduce the idea personal regulation versus external articulation.

Unfortunately, considering my colour, my name and I worked internationally I'm pretty sure this 

&gt;  certain secret service organisation has index 

has happened at some point and they've been bored to tears by how mundane it is.

So, let's say I wrote some thing in my emails that D-Hex2035 would find embarrassing and horrible when I was D-Hex2014. Now that ""future morality"" is beyond the control of D-Hex2014 so yes, in part D-Hex2035 cannot be held responsible for D-hex2014's views simply because D-Hex2014 isn't in possession of a time machine. However, if D-Hex2035 knew of D-Hex2014 and didn't either acknowledge and change those views, then D-Hex2035 is responsible for those views. 

In the Clarkson case, this doesn't happen. Clarkson is 54. If Clarkson age 10, in 1970 had sung that rhyme, then Clarkson44 to Clarkson54 has had 40 years to work out that the word Nigger is offensive. 

Now... if Clarkson had said in between 170 and 2014 that he thinks the word Nigger was perfectly reasonable to use and stuck to that through his life , then you could argue he was being consistent. It's not unheard of - check out the owner of the Clippers and his views. 

The problem, therefore, isn't that Clarkson is being mugged for a private conversation, which is what everyone seems to be upset about. The problem is that a man who managed to live through four decades of civil rights work - still thinks it's acceptable to consider such thing unproblematic enough to use in a jape. 

Secondly, let's talk about self-regulation and external articulation. The reason I raise the issue of the environment and the people around him is important for this reason. 

When we're in a social context, we regulate ourselves so that we articulate what we are comfortable with. So if you hang out with your mates, you'll do certain things and speak certain ways you won't when you're in front of the Queen. In some cultures, and in ours it's seen as a mark of genuineness that your behaviour doesn't change when you cross social groups. Indeed, if you look at Clarkson's career he's made a bit of schtick of how ""genuine"" he is. 

So now we have to ask the questions about his self-regulation. Did he feel comfortable enough to use ""nigger"" in the environment he was in because he felt it was possible to do? If so , why? What does this tell us about that environment? Why did he not feel the need to control that impulse? Did the Top Gear production team give him a platform or a structure where he felt this external articulation was possible?

If you used the word ""nigger"" at work you'd be fired. Does that mean that work is being over-sensitive, or that the environment that you work in has an accepted code of morality that you self-regulate to fit in. 

When companies and organisations investigate bullying at work that's one of the things they look at, how did the external culture enforce the norms and values they espoused. If your bosses let you run around the place calling people Nigger and Paki they would also be fired.

Please feel free to discuss this more, I think it's a really good question. ",0,1399152674,null,0,false,0,ch8s9ob,t3_24m1xa,t1_ch8s9ob,t1_ch8rldy,null,1433637495,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

Then when we break on the counter we are counting on our striker to hold up the ball (which all three current strikers are fairly poor at) or that a midfielder carries the ball 3/4 up the field and make a chance which isn't very fruitful. I hate to say this but the sale of Mata handcuffed us quite a bit due to Oscar's tendencies to drift back and defend where as Mata player much more in the hole behind the forward. Obviously we need a new striker as well as to keep Lukaku this year, but I also think we need a quality backup for Oscar this summer.

true,BaBaFiCo,derbyshire,S. Derbyshire,"The first major change is the restriction of choices at GCSE. Recent generations have seen increased choice that allowed them to study things like graphic design, psychology etc. From next year students must study the usual English, maths and science, plus one from history, geography or a foreign language. Expect the choices to decrease if they are voted into power again next term. 

Secondly is the abolition of modular exams. This year saw the abolition of retakes for students, forcing them to put all of their eggs into one basket and denying them the chance to better themselves. If this wasn't bad enough, over the coming years modular exams are being phased out. Whilst currently students would sit a variety of exams over the two years, Gove has reverted back to the single exam at the end of the course model. What this means is that students must cram everything they learnt in two years into one exam in June. 

Next they have abolished coursework. Studies have shown that independent coursework benefits certain students and allows them to flourish. It also mimics real world applications such as university or the work place. Again, Gove wants learning proven by a single exam after two years. 

Tiered exams have also been removed. Students may be used to sitting either a higher or foundation exam dependent on their ability. This will be no longer as a 'one size fits all' exam system is implemented. 

He has removed the tried, trusted and understood method of A*-U grades as of next year. GCSEs and A-Levels will be instead measured on a 1-9 scale. 

He wants to increase the number of academies and free schools operating independent of a local authority, free to hire unqualified teachers and in danger of degrading the education system. 

He wants to increase the school day so that it finishes at 6pm, leaving students and teachers exhausted and leaving no time for parents. 

He wants to start mandatory schooling at 2 years old and increasing the number of weeks students are at school. 

Not all of his changes are terrible, but the man is an ex journalist, completely unqualified for the position and toxic for the education of future generations. ",0,1399155176,null,0,false,0,ch8t70l,t3_24m19x,t1_ch8t70l,t1_ch8smtd,null,1433637931,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

If we accept Gerry Adams' arrest why is it that we consider an investigation into British war crimes 'not in public interest'?

true,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"&gt;Words are symbology. Words will always have power. This is the problem with the logical positivism that that people apply to social constructs. Words will always be ways of communicating ideas and as idea come with context , words will always have context attached. 

Context is defined by how a word is used - not the word itself. For example,  in Leeds for certain age groups 'sick' is often used as a positive remark opposed to it normally being used negatively.

Words aren't symbology, they're expression.

&gt;The only magical thinking prevalent in this case is that of the privileged and powerful trying to strip those words of the power they have. The idea that this word should suddenly lose its power and potency, when it was used to denigrate and abuse entire populations **within living memory**  is patently ridiculous. 

Power and potency are derived from frequency and context. In my house no one would bat an eyelid at being called a cunt. In Betty's however it would cause absolute silence.

Yeah Clarkson said a bad word. But;

1. It was never broadcast
2. He clearly realised what he was doing and attempted to stop himself.



&gt;It is not just a ""rude"" word. Its a classification of a people as subhuman. 

&gt;I fail to understand great warriors of civilisation , such as your good self, fail to realise this and keep defending. 

I don't see how you can't understand that words are purely contextual and are completely subjective from person to person. Stop being such a priss.

&gt;On top of that, as I've said elsewhere in this thread. The context of Clarkson's use makes it a little worse. Clarkson was under the impression that it was in private, the film would be edited out, and it would never come to light.  This indicates some fairly large issues for us as a society - a) that Clarkson thinks his views a perfectly alright in private

It had no representation of his views at all. He's an old man; when he was a child that version of the song was considered to be a lot more acceptable. Unlike your divine self most of us are subject to human error.

&gt;the production team and the structures around him accept this view  which indicates that c) the team around him didn't either have the gumption to stop him or d) they actually think it's perfectly alright for him to say that. 

&gt;For all those people, like yourself, who are so high on how progressive you all are and how much ""progress"" we've made but want us to ""get over it"". 

&gt;Those are some serious questions you should be asking about yourselves.

Some of those goals in that clip involved great skill. If you're referring to Crystal Palace, then it's not exactly a good game to base it on. There have been plenty of whoopings in recent years in the PL as well, I mean Arsenal, a top 4 team, have been hammered 5-1 and 6-0 this season, and there have been 7-0s and 8-0s recorded against the lower PL teams in recent years.

Clearly not because they could attract any player they wanted. I remember when City won the league, you think that would have happened if they hadn't been able to afford players of the caliber of Toure, Silva, or Aguero. Most importantly, they were bought when they were already finished products. We invested in Suarez and are reaping the benefits now. All those that have been standout performers for us this season were bought as an investment and have grown as players, or came through our academy. There is a reason that city and Chelsea have been dominating the league AFTER being bought out and drowned in billions. They bought expensive finished products and offered them stupid wages, and have KEPT doing this YEAR AFTER YEAR.

No, it isn't the single determining factor of league position, but it sure as hell pushes the odds one way or another.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I'm sorry but that's a dangerous over-simplification that belongs with the rest of the US-based libertarian nonsense that haunts this sub.

Firstly, Clarkson did what he did. No one forced him to. It doesn't really matter that he did in a ""safe"" environment. Those are his actions he should be responsible for them ( which is something libertarians are supposed to big on these days).

Secondly, words aren't simple ideas. They are idea full of context, meaning and symbols. WE, as a society, have agreed that there those particular words represent a morality we believe identifies humans who considered as equal as sub-human. WE (especially people who wrote that thing called the Convention on Human rights - which enshrine said ""free speech"") don't believe, as a society that human should be considered sub-human because of their skin colour.

Thirdly, this is a public act, committed in a space owned by a public institution on the public's pay roll. It's not a private space. Therefore our public space. The actions of that body is a reflection of our collective will because we own it. We have signed up to two declarations on human rights and have the human rights act as part of our society which bans discrimination of people according to race, colour, gender and sexuality into law. This person is in contravention of that spirit of our basic norms on human rights. 

Fourthly, freedom from abuse and discrimination is also a human right, as mentioned in the last point. Abuse for who you are and you innate nature as a human being is tyranny.

Fifthly, people who complain are pointing it out aren't the bad guys. It's like blaming a fire alarm for causing the fire. 

Lastly, at what point is is it action? At what point do I wait till someone who called me nigger is worth complaining about? At what point between calling me nigger to chasing me down the street should I wait to complain? 

Because believe me I have lived with the constant threat of racist burning down my house, in Britain , and I have been beaten for my skin colour, in Britain, at what point did you want me to complain? Before being admitted to Casualty or after the police refused to investigate it as a crime?

You know what stopped it? People who complained, people who stopped the racism being acceptable, people who made sure that racism was taken seriously.

&gt;Context is defined by how a word is used

Nope, context is defined by lots of things. History of words use, social factors, linguistic factors symbology, translation, register etc etc.  Please if you're going to wear the big boy/girl pants and bring in social science then I could wallop you with everything from Foucault on Power and to Fiedler in Behavioural Psychology. 


&gt;Power and potency are derived from frequency and context.

But as you've got the first part of context wrong. You also manage to miss out the fact that power and potency are historically retained in symbology and thus part of the context. Just hop over to the US and see how ""freedom"" gets layered with so much mythology and context that it has radically different triggers.

""Nigger"" has a specific historical context - ie racism and the use the word to dehumanise black people - that is retained and , that historical potency is accepted as NORMATIVE as damaging, hurtful and something that all of society accepts as shouldn't used as a joke. Simply put, any idiot in public life would know that the word is toxic because society has pretty much marked it out as being so. 

&gt;I don't see how you can't understand that words are purely contextual and are completely subjective from person to person

But you don't understand context, which kind of makes this point a bit moot. As proved above. 

&gt;It had no representation of his views at all. He's an old man; when he was a child that version of the song was considered to be a lot more acceptable. 

This is a very odd argument. Firstly, if the man is operating with a camera crew, a production team, and whoever else is on set then it would it's not a private - which is why I raise questions of self-regulation and controlling mechanisms.  

Secondly, if you're arguing that this doesn't represent his views, then are you arguing that he's deliberately quoting a child's nursery rhyme in that format even though that isn't what he thinks?  That's a very odd place to argue that it isn't racism - surely that makes it slightly worse - in that it's cynical racism?

I mean even for someone who's just written out a post defending the right of someone to say ""Nigger"" on the taxpayer's clock ( sorry hardworking taxpayer) - that's doozey.

To quote you: 

&gt;You're a ridicilous person who really needs to assess his or her outlook on life

But.. the thing is.. I'm not the one who has to think about why I just made excuses using hate-speech.

Janet got angry and shouted a lot. Janet looked desperately into the eyes of the other shoppers for support when she screamed 'do you really think I would be stealing from a shop like Tesco! That's a PRADA handbag you're emptying for goodness sake.' After a painful process in which the contents of her handbag were emptied onto the floor, it was discovered that the muppet at Superdrug had failed to swipe out the £1.99 mascara she'd bought, which also happened to set off Tesco alarms (yes folks, this really happens). On her way out, she shouted 'I hope you're proud that you did your job properly today! I've never been so embarrassed in all my life!' to the poor, unsuspecting security guard. 

On the way home Janet had to get the second train advertised because the first one was cancelled. When she arrived at her destination the bus, which was meant to drop her right outside her door, broke down. Poor old Janet, who was already NOT having a good day, had to walk the two miles home because the next bus wasn't due for 45 minutes. In three inch heels. It was a right **palaver**, and caused her bunions to hurt something rotten.

When Janet got home she told her mother about her awful day, and her mother made a right **fuss** of her, piling on cups of tea laced with rum and even getting out the special cupcakes she'd baked for the twins' birthday tomorrow.*

true,Denswend,null,null,"&gt;that's dangerous over-simplification

It's a true oversimplification. This is a single word not directed at anybody.

&gt;Those are his actions he should be responsible for them

No one is arguing that one should not be held responsible for his actions. It's just that the ""punishment"" is getting to me.

&gt;Secondly, words aren't simple ideas. They are idea full of context, meaning and symbols

True. But what you're doing here is charging a single word, an offensive word mind you, that is supposed to be exaggerated insult not true to the real nature of affairs (this is how insults work) with every single bad thing done to your race. Words are full of context, yes, but you do not get to simply charge the context-

&gt;WE, as a society, have agreed that there those particular words represent a morality we believe identifies humans who considered as equal as sub-human.

First thing, usage of WE implies that all of us have agreed with that. I certainly haven't. As for your ""one word representing evil morality"" thing, see above. If that single word is representative of this evil morality everytime when said by anybody, why isn't there a moral outrage when a black person says it? From this I infer that the context of the saying (the real context, not your ""one word all bad things whitey did"") is important - namely who says it (a black or white person) and with what intention he says it. Clarkson recited an old nursery ryhme, [for fucks sake, he didn't even say it clearly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hcsefsI1S4) - and this calls for this witch hunt by a group that is supposed to be for human rights? 


Your entire premise hinges on the fact a word, divorced from it's context (again, real context), is somehow abuse. It's not. Clarkson abused no one, and he discriminated no one. You're victimizing yourself in order to gain higher moral ground by emotionally charging one word with every bad thing that happened to your race. 

&gt;  Fifthly, people who complain are pointing it out aren't the bad guys. It's like blaming a fire alarm for causing the fire.

I'm not blaming people who complain about racism. I'm blaming people who complain about Clarkson's racism - which is quite simply, non-existent (see above) in order to censor and control public opinion. To borrow your analogy about fire, I'm blaming people who accuse a person carrying a matchstick for arson.


&gt;Lastly, at what point is is it action? At what point do I wait till someone who called me nigger is worth complaining about? At what point between calling me nigger to chasing me down the street should I wait to complain?

And this is something known as slippery slope fallacy. To imply that one action will lead to even more extreme action. To borrow your own fallacy, I could just as well say that by legalizing homosexuality, you'd be one step closer to pedophilia. Or I could simply say that you trying to censor one word when said by white people using white guilt complex would lead to enslaving whites by utilizing the same white guilt complex  Do you see why you don't use that fallacy? And to use it in such an emotionally evocative manner, that's a something I can respect from a purely rhetorical standpoint, but ultimately find morally abhorrent.

&gt;You know what stopped it? People who complained, people who stopped the racism being acceptable, people who made sure that racism was taken seriously.

You know what's going to start it again. People who cry wolf when surrounded by poodles. People who extend racism to such manner that even pure words are racist. Because they were used by the people who thought blacks are subhuman in time when blacks were universally considered subhuman. That's your whole idea isn't it? But I'm fairly certain that ""nigger"" is used today (when said by black people towards each other not in discriminatory way) in greater amount than when it was said by evil whiteys. Now to borrow your slippery slope, when are thoughts going to start becoming racist? When is simply being white going to start becoming racist? And how will we, a tolerant and progressive society deal with those vile racists? Perhaps we should burn them at the stake?


&gt;Now please explain to me again...and how does your support for racism by claiming free-speech prevent the tyranny of racism itself.

First off, I'm not supporting racism. You're putting words in my mouth and I find that disgusting form of rhetoric.
 
Secondly, you're using the deeds of someone's ancestors directed towards your ancestors as emotional fuel in order to change a meaning of one word in order to suit your agenda. Then you argue that the very usage of that word, divorced from its real context (to whom it was said, what was the motivation behind it, etc) is essentially tantamount to oppression. It's not and if you really believe that, then you're a morally abhorrent person who uses disgusting guilt tripping to further his own quest to rob others of their freedom by using distorted appeals to authority (they said abuse is bad, you using that word - because it was used by bad people who did bad things- abuses me, off to jail with you). Just because you ancestors were targeted with the oppression because of their skin color, and/or just because you were targeted with oppression because of your skin color, you have no right to censor other's right to say what he wants because you **feel** that it might end with you on a stake. The only thing that you have a right to do is to stop the angry mob from burning you at a stake. 

Words are only dangerous when acted upon, and even then, the only thing that we can morally do is prohibit the action by legal means, and not the thought or word behind it. Your silly idea that words=abuse is idiotical at best, and tyrannical at worst. Calling someone a nigger should be no more penalized as calling someone subhuman scum - and if it must be penalized then the penalty must be equal for **all** members of society. Beating someone because of his skin color should be penalized, yes , but only because the beating happened, not because that beating was because of race.

Tyranny requires action, and if tyranny is to be achieved then that action must happen. No tyranny happened because of words, only actions. Thus, freedom of speech is inherently not tied with the notion of racism. You seem to think that supporting free speech will give rise to tyranny or racism. It's not. You're essentially infringing on one of the most basic rights that can ever on the basis of pure fearmongering and guilt tripping. The very fact that you're not aware of it astounds me. Other possibility is that you are aware of it, and you're simply trying to push a tyranny of your own, a tyranny based wholly on guilt tripping and fear mongering.

For a start: 
&gt;A positional good is a good that people acquire to signalise where they stand in a social hierarchy; it is acquired in order to set oneself apart from others.

That's hilarious considering the history of civil rights and the amount of energy spent just getting anywhere hierarchy. It's a gross misreading of history. If this was the case - then over the last 100 years the hierarchy wouldn't have spent so much time finding ways of stopping racial equality happening. 

It also misunderstands cultural appropriation for political correctness. So if this was an argument about how the idea of ""Reggae"" has been appropriated by a bunch of trustafarians at a famous central London campus- it might work.  If the idea was that people adopt aspects of  left-ism to feel like they've achieved a certain goal , then it might just make it over the line as an argument. But as an argument against ""politcal correctness"" it doesn't work. 

Why? Because PC was meant to strip words of their abusive power and let people be free of the connotation they brought with them. It's a different argument to make that it may lost its power, or been abused, but the is the Institute of Economic Affairs , which doesn't do such things as talk about why PC was discovered as a concept ( mainly because its so right-wing if it was a ship it would be spinning clockwise)

Here's the thing. People have had to work very hard to make that coercion work. Remember all those people who were called hippies and lunatics for espouses equality? I know it's before you began writing, probably before I did, but I do remember it. That's coercion. 

MLK called it taking truth to power. Now here's the thing, you seem to be more hung up on the people not in power, being protected by anyone else who isn't them. 

It's a very weird place to argue your position as a liberal in the UK sense. 

Rauch makes an important point that you seem to ignore. It took the coercion of truth, the demonstrations, the anger, the campaigns to get to a point where not being an advocate for equality and human rights is not on the right side of history. 

In that respect, the people complaining meet Rauch's standards, they are using the coercion of truth. That coercion means anyone who works for our institutions , on our money, cannot by definition be someone who thinks that truth is optional.

You could make a fuss of a new baby, by giving it loads of attention and acting like it's the first baby to be born in the history of mankind. You can also make a fuss of a minor inconvenience e.g making a fuss because the bus was late.

Palaver is a disorganised commotion, causing people to become irate, e.g the wedding was a right palaver, the best man got drunk and mentioned that he'd sleep with the bride before she'd met the groom, the bride's mother fainted and we had to stop the groom's father from punching his lights out. 

Causing a scene is when someone through socially undesirable behaviour acts in a way that would cause bystanders to start rubbernecking out of curiosity. Rachel made a scene when she took her top off in the shopping centre and started running around screaming about her ex-boyfriend after too much vodka. 

So to consolidate, making fuss is when you overreact to something and make an issue about something, a palaver is an event or set of events that go awry, and a scene is when someone acts in a way that draws public attention to themselves in a negative fashion. 

That said, you could make a fuss of something, causing a right scene, resulting in an absolute palaver, but they're not the same things. It could be a palaver despite nobody making a fuss or a scene, it could be something unfortunate, the wedding could be a palaver just because something unfortunate happened like the groom's car broke down on the way to the church. Making a scene doesn't mean you made a fuss of something, you could just have someone acting like a nutter for valid reasons or intoxication. You can make a fuss of something without it escalating to a palaver if it didn't cause any disruption, and without it being a scene if the behaviour wasn't extreme enough to get you funny looks or if it was in private.
